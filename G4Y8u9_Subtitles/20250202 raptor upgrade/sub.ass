Dialogue: 1,0:15:08.30,0:15:13.25,中,,0,0,0,,我知道制造价格对于完全可复用的火箭似乎并不那么重要
Dialogue: 2,0:15:08.30,0:15:13.25,英,,0,0,0,,but I know price doesn't really seem all that important when the rocket is fully reusable
Dialogue: 1,0:15:13.25,0:15:15.42,中,,0,0,0,,因为火箭可以反复多次使用
Dialogue: 2,0:15:13.25,0:15:15.42,英,,0,0,0,,because they can just reuse it over and over.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:15.65,0:15:17.66,中,,0,0,0,,但SpaceX想得更远
Dialogue: 2,0:15:15.65,0:15:17.66,英,,0,0,0,,But SpaceX is dreaming big
Dialogue: 1,0:15:17.66,0:15:22.74,中,,0,0,0,,他们设想未来这些航天器会像今天的客机一样习以为常
Dialogue: 2,0:15:17.66,0:15:22.74,英,,0,0,0,,and pictures these vehicles being about as common in the future as airliners are today.

Dialogue: 1,0:15:33.41,0:15:39.04,中,,0,0,0,,把少量燃料直接注入发动机喷管喉部可以辅助冷却
Dialogue: 2,0:15:33.41,0:15:39.04,英,,0,0,0,,it's common to inject extra fuel directly into the throat of the engine to help cool it.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:39.19,0:15:43.96,中,,0,0,0,,在其他地方进行更保守的设计就有可能实现移除喉部膜冷却
Dialogue: 2,0:15:39.19,0:15:43.96,英,,0,0,0,,Removing throat film cooling can be accomplished by being more conservative in other areas,
Dialogue: 1,0:15:43.94,0:15:49.11,title,,900,0,45,,{\an7\fs140\1c&H2354ED&}膜冷却
Dialogue: 1,0:15:44.10,0:15:48.65,中,,0,0,0,,比如增加头部 也就是喷注器的膜冷却
Dialogue: 2,0:15:44.10,0:15:48.65,英,,0,0,0,,such as increasing the head in film cooling, otherwise known as injector film cooling,
Dialogue: 1,0:15:48.89,0:15:53.17,中,,0,0,0,,或者干脆让主燃烧室内进行更加富燃的燃烧
Dialogue: 2,0:15:48.89,0:15:53.17,英,,0,0,0,,or even just going further fuel rich in your overall main combustion chamber.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:53.17,0:15:58.54,中,,0,0,0,,SpaceX目前正在研究并评估这样的简化设计是否值得
Dialogue: 2,0:15:53.17,0:15:58.54,英,,0,0,0,,SpaceX is currently studying and evaluating whether or not it's worth it to simplify the engine,
Dialogue: 1,0:15:58.54,0:16:02.25,中,,0,0,0,,虽然扩大头部的膜冷却规模会导致性能的损失
Dialogue: 2,0:15:58.54,0:16:02.25,英,,0,0,0,,despite the performance hit, it will take from additional head in film cooling.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:02.63,0:16:08.65,中,,0,0,0,,但考虑到他们对简化设计的追求 我们未来或许能看到该技术的实现
Dialogue: 2,0:16:02.63,0:16:08.65,英,,0,0,0,,But with the obsession to simplify the engine, perhaps this will be something we see in the future.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:08.65,0:16:13.60,中,,0,0,0,,另一方面 预计猛禽发动机的燃烧室室压和推力将进一步提升
Dialogue: 2,0:16:08.65,0:16:13.60,英,,0,0,0,,Another thing to look for, we definitely expect to see Raptor increase chamber pressure and thrust.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:13.83,0:16:17.14,中,,0,0,0,,我们已知他们的推力目标是250吨
Dialogue: 2,0:16:13.83,0:16:17.14,英,,0,0,0,,We know they're aiming to reach about 250 tons of thrust,
Dialogue: 1,0:16:17.33,0:16:21.38,中,,0,0,0,,意味着主燃烧室室压会逼近330bar
Dialogue: 2,0:16:17.33,0:16:21.38,英,,0,0,0,,which would likely be closer to 330 bar in the main chamber.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:21.53,0:16:24.40,中,,0,0,0,,SpaceX已经在之前的测试中达到过330bar
Dialogue: 2,0:16:21.53,0:16:24.40,英,,0,0,0,,SpaceX has hit 330 bar in a test before,
Dialogue: 1,0:16:24.40,0:16:27.10,中,,0,0,0,,但要实现稳定运行仍需进一步改进
Dialogue: 2,0:16:24.40,0:16:27.10,英,,0,0,0,,but sustaining that will take additional improvements.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:27.10,0:16:31.79,中,,0,0,0,,不过还是要记住 猛禽发动机仍处于开发的初级阶段
Dialogue: 2,0:16:27.10,0:16:31.79,英,,0,0,0,,One of the biggest things to remember is overall Raptor is still very much in its infancy.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:31.91,0:16:37.30,中,,0,0,0,,马斯克提到过 梅林发动机已经进化到其初始版本的两倍以上性能
Dialogue: 2,0:16:31.91,0:16:37.30,英,,0,0,0,,Elon has mentioned how the Merlin engine has been evolved to be over twice as powerful as when it first came out,
Dialogue: 1,0:16:37.50,0:16:40.69,中,,0,0,0,,梅林现在几乎被榨干了全部潜力
Dialogue: 2,0:16:37.50,0:16:40.69,英,,0,0,0,,but that engine has pretty much reached its full potential.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:40.69,0:16:43.66,中,,0,0,0,,而此时 猛禽才刚刚起步
Dialogue: 2,0:16:40.69,0:16:43.66,英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, Raptor is still just at the very beginning.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:43.84,0:16:48.90,中,,0,0,0,,我期待着猛禽未来推力更大 重量更轻 更可靠 成本更低
Dialogue: 2,0:16:43.84,0:16:48.90,英,,0,0,0,,I expect it to continue to become more powerful, lighter, more reliable, and cheaper,
Dialogue: 1,0:16:49.33,0:16:54.60,中,,0,0,0,,我相信很快就能看到 我相信SpaceX有能力做到
Dialogue: 2,0:16:49.33,0:16:54.60,英,,0,0,0,,and I expect it to do all of these things in a hurry, now that SpaceX has the means to do so.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:54.60,0:16:55.74,中,,0,0,0,,大家怎么看呢?
Dialogue: 2,0:16:54.60,0:16:55.74,英,,0,0,0,,So what do you think?
Dialogue: 1,0:16:55.88,0:16:58.75,中,,0,0,0,,大家认为猛禽2相比猛禽1 改进算巨大吗?
Dialogue: 2,0:16:55.88,0:16:58.75,英,,0,0,0,,Do you think Raptor 2 is a nice big improvement over Raptor 1?
Dialogue: 1,0:16:58.85,0:17:00.69,中,,0,0,0,,还是你觉得这仅仅是开始?
Dialogue: 2,0:16:58.85,0:17:00.69,英,,0,0,0,,Or do you kind of think this is just the beginning?
Dialogue: 1,0:17:00.89,0:17:03.32,中,,0,0,0,,或者说猛禽路线根本走不通?
Dialogue: 2,0:17:00.89,0:17:03.32,英,,0,0,0,,Or maybe you think Raptor is a dead end
Dialogue: 1,0:17:03.32,0:17:07.90,中,,0,0,0,,未来某天SpaceX会回到梅林这样更简单的发动机上?
Dialogue: 2,0:17:03.32,0:17:07.90,英,,0,0,0,,and we'll actually see SpaceX go back to a simpler engine, more like Merlin or something someday.
