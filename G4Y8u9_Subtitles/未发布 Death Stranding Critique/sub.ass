Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.77,0:03:13.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the point is if we're not honest about the game's shortcomings

Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.28,0:03:20.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,And if you've played Death Stranding for any length of time

Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.05,0:03:25.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I just want to reiterate that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.57,0:03:29.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,while I am very conflicted on many of the design choices made here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.31,0:03:33.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I am going to spend most of this video explaining all of the problems with the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.68,0:03:37.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,I really did enjoy my time with Death Stranding on the whole.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.19,0:03:40.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,If I had to describe the game concisely
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.04,0:03:44.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,I would say that it's a repetitive relaxing and uncomplicated game
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.65,0:03:48.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,that is overly reliant on ambiguous storytelling
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.40,0:03:54.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,and falls victim to some very bizarre directorial decisions at the hands of Hideo Kojima,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.09,0:03:58.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,a man so closely tied to Death Stranding that he and the game are inextricably tied,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.71,0:04:01.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,mostly due to his own statements saying as much.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.49,0:04:05.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's also probably important that I mentioned my qualifications for making this video.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.47,0:04:09.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,I've put in well over a hundred hours into Death Stranding on two separate PS4s,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.75,0:04:14.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,a Slim and a Pro, to get an idea of what this game can do technically,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.56,0:04:16.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,something will touch on lightly later.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.79,0:04:20.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,I read all of the Emails, completed all of the premium deliveries,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.07,0:04:23.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,fought all of the BTs, drove all of the vehicles, talked to every celebrity,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.85,0:04:25.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,shook all babies hunted down the memory chips,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.92,0:04:30.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,five-star the locations, explored the whole map and after all of that,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.04,0:04:33.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,I can say confidently the Death Stranding is by far,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.83,0:04:38.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,the most ironic game that I have ever played in my life.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.14,0:04:41.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,You see the game was advertised as a new genre of game,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.20,0:04:45.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,something that would focus on positivity and connecting people from all over the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.67,0:04:51.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,But instead it's become one of the most divisive games of the last decade, maybe of all time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.23,0:04:53.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,Some will say that the world is empty boring,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.84,0:04:56.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,and the gameplay is repetitive and the writing is terrible.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.35,0:04:59.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,While others will say the Death Stranding is a triumph,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.29,0:05:02.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,a game that try something new and succeeds,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.17,0:05:05.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,a game focused on connections and fulfillment.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.56,0:05:09.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the amazing thing is that everyone here is kind of right.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.92,0:05:13.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I know that sounds like an oxymoron or completely nonsensical
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.54,0:05:16.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I think I can actually defend that statement throughout the course of this video.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.79,0:05:18.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,But this is my primary point,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.41,0:05:23.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,the Death Stranding was advertised and held up as a game that would bring people together.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.95,0:05:29.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I can't help but find it extremely ironic that it is done the exact opposite.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.44,0:05:31.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now as we move forward into the video
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.09,0:05:34.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,I ask that you please hear me out on all the critiques I have for the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.76,0:05:36.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,Furthermore I'd also like for you to

Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.88,0:05:43.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,I will be reading through all of them.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.96,0:05:47.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'd say that you should only play Death Stranding
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.47,0:05:50.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,if you have already been intrigued by it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.49,0:05:53.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,Which if you are, chances are you've already played it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.48,0:05:57.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,The unfortunate reality is that if you're skeptical of death stranding to any degree
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.75,0:06:00.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,or if there are things that have repelled you thus far,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.37,0:06:03.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,the game isn't going to convince you otherwise.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.18,0:06:04.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the bizarre thing is that
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.59,0:06:09.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,it seems as though this was a conscious design choice on the part of Kojima Productions.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.27,0:06:13.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,That or it's just blatant stupidity something that we're gonna discuss in just a moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.86,0:06:17.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,However if there is any chance that you're going to play this game

Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.53,0:06:22.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,Don't worry, this video will still be here once you're done.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.02,0:06:23.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,Also a couple of things that you should know

Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.33,0:07:31.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,And of course it should go without saying
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.07,0:07:33.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,but this video is going to spoil pretty much everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.49,0:07:35.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,So consider this your spoiler warning.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.94,0:07:38.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,But with all of that said, let's get into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.62,0:08:01.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,The first impressions that a game gives the player are extremely important.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.39,0:08:03.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,They're important for a variety of reasons
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.18,0:08:06.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,but chief among them is that they serve to convince players
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.26,0:08:10.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,who are skeptical of the game's quality that they should continue playing.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.31,0:08:12.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now normally for a $60 release,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.36,0:08:16.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,if somebody has gone through the trouble of paying that amount of money for the game
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.36,0:08:20.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,chances are they're already fairly confident that they're going to enjoy the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.89,0:08:25.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,So what's the point of having an extremely polished first two hours or so
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.56,0:08:28.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,if players are already forking over cash.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.50,0:08:31.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,Well for one I would hope that the artists creating the game
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.14,0:08:34.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,would want players to be intrigued by the title that they've put forward.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.84,0:08:37.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,But furthermore, Death Stranding is such a polarizing game,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.74,0:08:42.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,and the gameplay was such a matter of debate before its release
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.31,0:08:47.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,that many people watched streams and clips of the introductory hours of gameplay
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.71,0:08:50.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,to decide whether or not they were going to try it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.26,0:08:52.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is … pretty freakin gorgeous.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.66,0:08:54.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean for real, look at this, Norman Reedus,

Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.86,0:09:02.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the unfortunate reality for Kojima Productions is that
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.59,0:09:08.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,many people started playing the game and decided to quit within the first few hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.51,0:09:12.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is a selection of responses from the survey I mentioned earlier.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.35,0:09:23.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,were that they said the first few hours were uninteresting, slow, boring, confusing,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.81,0:09:26.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,and even not as advertised.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.50,0:09:31.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now it's fair that every game is going to have some players who drop off after starting it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.48,0:09:34.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,That's completely unavoidable, even for a masterpiece.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.70,0:09:37.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the key takeaway is that going into the game,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.54,0:09:40.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,the major contention on everybody's minds
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.51,0:09:46.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,were whether or not this game was going to be uninteresting, slow, boring, or confusing.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.06,0:09:52.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the first few hours of the game certainly didn't help these preconceived notions.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.28,0:09:54.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,But what specifically did Kojima do?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.90,0:09:57.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,Well, he started the story in a very strategic way,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.70,0:10:02.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,where Sam is just another porter performing normal deliveries like everybody else.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.54,0:10:06.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's implied that there's essentially an army of these types of porters

Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.37,0:10:12.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I'll be honest, I like this more than the alternative.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.60,0:10:15.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,Like in the old school God of War games, like God of War three
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.97,0:10:19.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,where you have all of the abilities up front and then they're ripped from you
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.42,0:10:21.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,after you've tasted the forbidden fruit
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.38,0:10:24.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,of what the player could look forward to having later in the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.97,0:10:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it doesn't change the fact that this starts very slow.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.98,0:10:35.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,And you're forced to transport cargo on foot for the first few hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.48,0:10:37.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,Furthermore it goes on for a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.51,0:10:40.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,The first two hours really do feel like a trudge.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.01,0:10:42.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I don't think that this is a controversial thing to say
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.84,0:10:45.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,even if you are a fan of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:45.03,0:10:50.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, I enjoyed my time with Death Stranding, but this is simply a reality.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.40,0:10:54.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,The first few hours, the pacing is all over the place.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.57,0:10:58.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,There also aren't very many interesting gameplay mechanics introduced here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.77,0:11:01.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,In fact the only missions that you're sent on
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.18,0:11:04.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,are to deliver a small package of drugs to a dying president,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:04.74,0:11:08.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,assist a corpse disposal crew, you watch some cutscenes,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.37,0:11:12.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then you are asked to incinerate the president's body after she's croaked.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.72,0:11:15.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I don't really have an issue with these types of deliveries.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.68,0:11:20.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,In fact I actually find them fairly relaxing and satisfying as I mentioned earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.21,0:11:25.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it does reaffirm the stereotype that Death Stranding is just a walking simulator,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.60,0:11:28.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially because there's no real dynamic encounters,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:28.64,0:11:33.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,there's no animals that you'll encounter in the world when you're going on these trips.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.13,0:11:37.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's just you, walking with some type of cargo strapped to your back,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.23,0:11:42.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,trying to keep balance as you walk across a large open field, scattered with rocks,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.18,0:11:46.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,that are just there to make it slightly tedious for you to walk from point A to point B
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.82,0:11:51.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, not inherently bad, it just reaffirms the preconceived notion
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.19,0:11:55.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,that Death Stranding only has walking to offer in terms of gameplay.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.65,0:11:59.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,Even though as we'll find out later in the game, there's much more to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:59.46,0:12:01.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now the baseline gameplay loop
Dialogue: 0,0:12:01.04,0:12:05.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,is made up of course of transporting cargo from one location to another
Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.01,0:12:10.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,or going to one location receiving cargo and returning it, in other words, a fetch quest.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:10.43,0:12:13.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now some people have heavily criticized the game for the core gameplay loop,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:13.98,0:12:17.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,being made up of this very simple task, which I actually disagree with.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.44,0:12:20.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,Any activity can be turned into a game.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.70,0:12:25.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,Given enough attention and time whether it's farming, hunting, or even talking,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.82,0:12:30.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,all of these things can be turned into an experience that's worth playing.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.27,0:12:34.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, Death Stranding's gameplay system grows more complex over the course of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:34.72,0:12:38.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,They had guns, grenade launchers, monster boss fights that are dynamic,
Dialogue: 0,0:12:38.91,0:12:42.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,BT zones, and even humanoid enemies known as mules
Dialogue: 0,0:12:42.59,0:12:45.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,that track your every movement and can hunt you down.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:45.44,0:12:48.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, you will need to get past around the 10-hour-mark
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.84,0:12:51.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,to see most of these things in full capacity.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.37,0:12:53.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,And some of these things such as grenade launchers
Dialogue: 0,0:12:53.73,0:12:57.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,aren't even introduced until 25 to 30 hours in.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:57.55,0:13:00.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this is one of the necessary frustrations with Death Stranding,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.54,0:13:02.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's a result of the studio that made it.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:02.92,0:13:10.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,Like many Japanese titles your time is required to buy into the world and the gameplay.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.25,0:13:12.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I actually have a few examples.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:12.19,0:13:16.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,Monster Hunter World for instance is a Japanese action RPG that I love to death.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.80,0:13:21.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it requires a steep learning curve and a lot of effort on the player's part

Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.37,0:13:26.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,that contribute to a fully mid maxed build.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.85,0:13:29.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,I've put in roughly a hundred hours into Monster Hunter World
Dialogue: 0,0:13:29.87,0:13:32.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I'm still learning new things that the game has to offer.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.86,0:13:35.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or look at Persona 5's introductory section
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.34,0:13:42.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,that can last by itself 15 to 22 hours depending on your play style and pace.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:42.88,0:13:45.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,And yes, that's considered the introduction.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.88,0:13:50.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is, Japanese game development is different than westernized game development.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.85,0:13:52.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,Their games tend to have a lot of meat to them
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.86,0:13:55.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they require a lot of time on the player's part
Dialogue: 0,0:13:55.85,0:14:00.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,in order to buy into and understand everything that there is to offer.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.48,0:14:05.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this actually causes a lot of Western players to be turned off by these types of games.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:05.48,0:14:09.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,Like it or not, western gamers are very impatient.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:09.24,0:14:14.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,And if a game is not grabbing a player within the first hour or even maybe two hours,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.16,0:14:15.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,they're just gonna walk away.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:15.64,0:14:17.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I don't think there's anything wrong with that,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.37,0:14:20.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's just a feature of our culture I suppose.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.04,0:14:22.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the point is Kojima even knew this,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.53,0:14:28.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why he roasted Americans for not having the quote-unquote "artistic sensibilities"
Dialogue: 0,0:14:28.06,0:14:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,on the level required to appreciate games such as Death Stranding to their fully extent.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.89,0:14:52.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,the first two hours are polished to high heaven and they are great.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.62,0:14:57.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or The Witcher 3, where the Griffin fight is front-loaded as with some …

Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.48,0:15:09.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is, a majority of AAA western titles,

Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.49,0:15:23.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the strange thing is that Death Stranding kind of meets this halfway.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:23.57,0:15:26.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,What I mean is that the gameplay system is not very robust,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.90,0:15:29.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,or extremely dense and complicated,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:29.54,0:15:35.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,requiring hours upon hours of intensive research and studying to understand it.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:35.02,0:15:36.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,Rather it's pretty simple,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:36.75,0:15:41.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,and just requires the player to mindlessly deliver packages from point A to point B.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:41.87,0:15:46.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,What does require a huge amount of investment on the part of the player is the narrative.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:59.80,0:16:02.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I don't know about you but when I saw this first
Dialogue: 0,0:16:02.15,0:16:04.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,I was concerned that they weren't actually going to have answers

Dialogue: 0,0:16:06.59,0:16:10.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,But they actually do, and it looks like Kojima thought most of this through
Dialogue: 0,0:16:10.41,0:16:14.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least in as bizarre way as you would expect from Kojima.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.39,0:16:17.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,You just have to wait roughly 38 hours to get those answers.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:17.92,0:16:20.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,Other problems also arise due to the fact
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.34,0:16:24.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,that the game was developed narratively and written in Japanese
Dialogue: 0,0:16:24.05,0:16:28.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then it was "ported" … get it? … over to English.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.08,0:16:30.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is actually incredibly important to understand
Dialogue: 0,0:16:30.13,0:16:34.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I think it's a reason why a lot of the writing in Death Stranding has been panned.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:34.37,0:16:36.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is a Japanese written story.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.58,0:16:41.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,Thus the dialogue is translated from the original writings of Kojima and his team
Dialogue: 0,0:16:41.97,0:16:44.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,into English for the actors.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:44.41,0:16:49.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this can at times lead to some really strange and clunky phrasings.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:49.18,0:16:51.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,But don't worry we'll get to this more later.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.69,0:16:56.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now you could argue that Death Stranding front-load some of its more flashy cinematic sequences

Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.07,0:17:29.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,which i think is actually okay because it is a prologue after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:29.31,0:17:33.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think if a prologue wasn't at least somewhat confusing and intriguing
Dialogue: 0,0:17:33.62,0:17:35.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,it probably wouldn't be doing its job.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:35.86,0:17:37.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,But from here the story progresses.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:46.52,0:18:50.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,on the direction and the writing as opposed to the performances.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:50.78,0:18:57.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,However some of the performances that we see are downright bizarre and laughably bad.

Dialogue: 0,0:23:42.49,0:23:45.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or the fact that all of the boss fights are extremely clunky
Dialogue: 0,0:23:45.57,0:23:49.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,and don't actually put the player in much physical danger
Dialogue: 0,0:23:51.06,0:23:56.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,with the extremely generous reload system that they've put in place with the repatriation.

Dialogue: 0,0:26:44.80,0:26:47.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now each act has its own focus.

Dialogue: 0,0:26:58.39,0:27:01.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,when they say most players have to get over the hump.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:01.11,0:27:03.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,Act 2 is gameplay focused,

Dialogue: 0,0:27:08.24,0:27:12.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,It features upgraded equipment and really lets the line out for the player.

Dialogue: 0,0:27:27.82,0:27:31.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,These can be as numerous or as scarce as the player wants.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:31.51,0:27:35.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a nice way of reminding the player that there are other people that exist in the world

Dialogue: 0,0:27:38.67,0:27:40.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,But to be honest I really like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:40.37,0:27:43.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,The idea that if I drop a package it's not a total loss.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:43.97,0:27:47.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,And that somebody else may come along pick it up and deliver it for me.

Dialogue: 0,0:29:05.24,0:29:09.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,So make sure you've got your popcorn popped before you head into the last few chapters.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:09.47,0:29:13.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I do want to say there are some fantastic performances as I said earlier.

Dialogue: 0,0:29:15.34,0:29:17.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now through all these chapters you're exploring the map,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:17.70,0:29:20.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,Death Stranding was of course made with the Decima Engine
Dialogue: 0,0:29:20.12,0:29:22.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is the same engine that was used for Horizon Zero Dawn
Dialogue: 0,0:29:22.86,0:29:27.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,which itself featured a plethora of highly varied biomes
Dialogue: 0,0:29:27.31,0:29:32.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,and made the world feel as though it spanned a much larger area than it actually did.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:32.13,0:29:37.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I might be picky but it seems as though this world really isn't as varied
Dialogue: 0,0:29:37.22,0:29:40.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,as it was initially made out to be.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:40.10,0:29:44.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,Even though it's meant to span effectively the entire United States,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:44.18,0:29:47.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,it really doesn't feel extremely large.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:47.00,0:29:50.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,In fact at the very end of the game one of your final assignments
Dialogue: 0,0:29:50.10,0:29:54.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,is to cross back over every square inch of the map that you've traveled
Dialogue: 0,0:29:54.47,0:29:57.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,to get back to the east coast on foot.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:57.70,0:30:00.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,I like the meta implications of this assignment
Dialogue: 0,0:30:00.06,0:30:02.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it makes you go back and see how far you've come.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:02.68,0:30:08.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,But when I was doing this I realized it only took me 20 to 30 minutes to travel all that way.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:08.68,0:30:10.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,And again maybe I'm being picky,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:10.56,0:30:15.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,but it seems as though for a map that's supposed to represent the entire United States,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:15.57,0:30:17.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,it really isn't very big.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:17.64,0:30:18.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I digress.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:18.53,0:30:20.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,We'll discuss that more later in the gameplay section
Dialogue: 0,0:30:20.80,0:30:23.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,when we address the worlds layout and construction.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:23.74,0:30:26.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,But for now let's discuss the opening of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:26.29,0:30:30.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,As I stated earlier, the opening of Death Stranding isn't very effective.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:30.32,0:30:35.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,But this does beg the question: what would be effective?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:35.00,0:30:39.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now by effective, I mean what do the opening hours have to achieve
Dialogue: 0,0:30:39.09,0:30:42.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,and in order to convince players skeptical and not
Dialogue: 0,0:30:42.68,0:30:46.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,that it's actually worth playing past these opening hours.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:46.29,0:30:48.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now in my estimation it seems that for each game
Dialogue: 0,0:30:48.97,0:30:51.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,this is going to be different depending on the context.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:51.68,0:30:57.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,What I mean is that the opening hours of Fallout 4 or Cyberpunk 2077 are going to be different
Dialogue: 0,0:30:57.56,0:30:59.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,depending on how they were pitched.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:59.17,0:31:03.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,The public's perception of the company that's publishing and creating the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:03.14,0:31:07.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it can even be influenced by something as generic as the price tag.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:07.98,0:31:14.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,For a $60 game for instance, one would expect an extremely expansive polished experience.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:14.98,0:31:19.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,Whereas if Kojima were to only charge $40 for Death Stranding,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:19.02,0:31:22.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,people would go into it with a lesser expectation.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:22.10,0:31:25.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is why Naughty Dog when they released the Lost Legacy
Dialogue: 0,0:31:25.06,0:31:29.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,which was actually a standalone Uncharted game even though most people haven't heard of it,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:29.27,0:31:33.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,they were able to get away with an experience that's only 6 hours long
Dialogue: 0,0:31:33.20,0:31:37.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,and is very very narrow compared to that of Uncharted 4,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:37.65,0:31:42.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,all because they only charged $40 for the game out of the gate.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:42.25,0:31:47.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,They set the expectation and then the game was able to live up to that expectation.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:47.61,0:31:51.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,With Death Stranding, there are a lot of preconceived notions
Dialogue: 0,0:31:51.67,0:31:55.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,that players have and had going into it.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:55.35,0:32:00.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,To me it seems as though Death Stranding should have tried to convince a lot of skeptical people
Dialogue: 0,0:32:00.45,0:32:03.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,that the game isn't that which its critics claim it to be.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:03.97,0:32:08.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,Of course fans of Kojima's work were going to be interested regardless.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:08.13,0:32:11.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,They were going to play it all the way through no matter what.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:11.26,0:32:16.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this is reflected in the pole that I took of players of Death Stranding.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:16.06,0:32:19.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,But new players have to be convinced of its worth.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:19.80,0:32:22.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I don't even think this is a controversial thing to say
Dialogue: 0,0:32:22.81,0:32:25.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I'm sure there will be some disagreeing in the comments.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:25.41,0:32:27.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,But at least hear me out.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:27.11,0:32:30.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,Specifically what I mean is that Death Stranding has to prove that

Dialogue: 0,0:32:45.16,0:32:48.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,which I actually disagree with, but again I'll discuss that later.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:48.65,0:32:51.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,I know I've said that a thousand times but I will.

Dialogue: 0,0:33:19.66,0:33:21.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,that players would be convinced that
Dialogue: 0,0:33:21.09,0:33:24.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,there was more to this gameplay system than initially seemed present.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:24.98,0:33:27.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,Kojima could have done this in a plethora of ways.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:27.18,0:33:30.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,For one he could have started the game with a massive BT battle,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:30.08,0:33:34.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,not just a cutscene of it, but an actual gameplay system
Dialogue: 0,0:33:34.03,0:33:37.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,showing how you can fight these things as you do later on.

Dialogue: 0,0:33:50.33,0:33:52.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again nobody was skeptical of the fact
Dialogue: 0,0:33:52.92,0:33:58.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,that Kojima had a really beautiful and bizarre world to play with in Death Stranding.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:58.76,0:34:02.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,What they doubted was the gameplay that backed that story up.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:02.99,0:34:06.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now some of you may think that all of these things shouldn't be very important.

Dialogue: 0,0:34:20.61,0:34:24.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,I respectfully disagree it, should be enough.
