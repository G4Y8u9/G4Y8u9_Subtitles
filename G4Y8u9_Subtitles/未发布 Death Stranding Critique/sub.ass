Dialogue: 0,1:02:08.43,1:02:13.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because the game allows you to play it in just passive enough a state

Dialogue: 0,1:05:17.30,1:05:20.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,And of course there are basically no NPCs

Dialogue: 0,1:06:08.74,1:06:11.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,even if I spent a week writing it out.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:11.53,1:06:13.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,Chances are if you made it this far into the video,

Dialogue: 0,1:06:17.36,1:06:21.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,So … I won't bore you with explaining all of it over again.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:21.16,1:06:25.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is that Kojima actually explains a lot of the stuff that goes on

Dialogue: 0,1:06:48.64,1:06:52.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's no big gameplay finale other than a large BT fight I guess.

Dialogue: 0,1:06:55.73,1:06:59.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's also the sequence with Higgs fistfight with him
Dialogue: 0,1:06:59.13,1:07:04.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is clunkier than almost anything else in the game, it's … really terrible.

Dialogue: 0,1:07:20.72,1:07:22.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it does feel like purgatory.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:22.37,1:07:25.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because as you run from one end of the Beach to the other,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:25.55,1:07:28.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,you will eventually just get spawned back further.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:28.17,1:07:32.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's basically the story of Sisyphus and it's actually pretty cool.

Dialogue: 0,1:07:35.31,1:07:39.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,However after the first 10 minutes or so it starts to get pretty horrible.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:39.53,1:07:43.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again is this just a poorly designed way of forcing the player
Dialogue: 0,1:07:43.34,1:07:47.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,to sit through all of the credits rolling incredibly slowly?
Dialogue: 0,1:07:47.20,1:07:51.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or, is this some sort of meta discussion of the purgatory
Dialogue: 0,1:07:51.67,1:07:58.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,that we all experience when talking about post-credit scenes in games and move …

Dialogue: 0,1:08:46.41,1:08:51.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,Point is you have a gun, and you can choose to shoot her or you can run after her and hug her,

Dialogue: 0,1:08:54.95,1:08:57.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now she gives a bunch of forewarning and she says

Dialogue: 0,1:09:06.34,1:09:11.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's saying that it's all about connecting people forgiving and embracing others.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:11.10,1:09:15.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,So going up to her and hugging her seems like the natural choice.

Dialogue: 0,1:09:37.91,1:09:40.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,which doesn't actually do anything.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:40.27,1:09:43.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,At which point I ran up to her to try and punch her

Dialogue: 0,1:09:52.51,1:09:57.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I was made to feel as though I just made an incredible and generous decision
Dialogue: 0,1:09:57.13,1:09:59.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,when in reality it was kind of an accident.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:59.84,1:10:02.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now maybe I'm the weird one here.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:02.20,1:10:06.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,But this made the ending sequence really awkward,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:06.48,1:10:09.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because it feels as though I kind of broke it.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:09.43,1:10:13.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,It didn't expect me to shoot her in the back of the head, empty my rounds,

Dialogue: 0,1:13:49.05,1:13:54.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it seems as though this is what has broken the cycle of all of these BBs,
Dialogue: 0,1:13:54.03,1:13:58.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,having their souls effectively destroyed in the incinerator.
Dialogue: 0,1:13:58.25,1:14:02.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,Holding Lou, Sam walks out of the incinerator into the open air,

Dialogue: 0,1:14:22.42,1:14:23.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now what does all of this mean?
Dialogue: 0,1:14:23.63,1:14:27.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,Well it seems as though the {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0} has officially come to a close.
Dialogue: 0,1:14:27.08,1:14:34.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,And BB's revitalization has effectively restored the stability of humanity … or … something.
Dialogue: 0,1:14:34.02,1:14:37.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,However I will be honest this is so vague
Dialogue: 0,1:14:37.04,1:14:39.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,that there are probably a million different ways to interpret it.
Dialogue: 0,1:14:39.68,1:14:41.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's not particularly important
Dialogue: 0,1:14:41.33,1:14:45.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,because everyone will have their own interpretation which is kind of the point.
Dialogue: 0,1:14:45.19,1:14:50.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,What I will say is that it's a very calming peaceful and emotional end
Dialogue: 0,1:14:50.58,1:14:53.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,even if I don't completely understand what's going on.
Dialogue: 0,1:14:53.87,1:14:59.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,Why was BB able to be restored even though necrosisation was starting to set in.

Dialogue: 0,1:15:13.73,1:15:16.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,But again that's probably not the point.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:16.51,1:15:19.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,I would be interested however in hearing your theories as to
Dialogue: 0,1:15:19.33,1:15:22.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,what exactly happened when BB was saved here.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:22.22,1:15:26.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'm sure some of you have thought this through and have a reasonable explanation.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:26.25,1:15:27.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,I would love to hear it below.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:27.98,1:15:29.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,And then the actual credits roll.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:29.72,1:15:35.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,And after all of that happens, we are greeted with episode 15 prompted up to us,
Dialogue: 0,1:15:35.13,1:15:38.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,and a quick reading that shows two weeks before.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:38.14,1:15:43.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this is what I meant earlier when I said that chapter 15 is basically indefinite.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:43.30,1:15:48.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,It goes on forever even though it's just two weeks before the presidential inauguration.
Dialogue: 0,1:15:48.38,1:15:51.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is effectively {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0}'s endgame state.

Dialogue: 0,1:15:58.56,1:16:01.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,and complete any other things that they might have left undone.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:01.58,1:16:06.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now overall the story while it is kind of bizarre and crazy,
Dialogue: 0,1:16:06.10,1:16:11.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,it is thought through, and it does have justifications and rules that govern it,
Dialogue: 0,1:16:11.23,1:16:14.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is what I said at the beginning I was looking for.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:14.48,1:16:17.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,However there are a couple of missed opportunities
Dialogue: 0,1:16:17.39,1:16:20.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,I can't help to wonder why Kojima didn't explore more.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:20.96,1:16:24.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,They might have been that it just felt like it wasn't focused,
Dialogue: 0,1:16:24.16,1:16:27.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,or it might have been something that never occurred to him, I'm not entirely sure.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:27.98,1:16:32.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,Specifically something such as the discussion that has to do with BB's and slavery.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:32.90,1:16:36.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is briefly touched on but it's not really elaborated upon.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:36.30,1:16:39.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,Specifically, babies come from mothers who died while pregnant,
Dialogue: 0,1:16:39.66,1:16:42.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why those mothers are called still mothers.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:42.53,1:16:47.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,There are also other times that this concept is applied within the world of {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0},
Dialogue: 0,1:16:47.27,1:16:49.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,such as with mama, who we know was to give birth
Dialogue: 0,1:16:49.99,1:16:52.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,but was trapped in rubble after the {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,1:16:52.94,1:16:55.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,which resulted in the baby becoming caught
Dialogue: 0,1:16:55.01,1:16:59.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,between the world of the living, and the Beach, or the world of the dead.
Dialogue: 0,1:16:59.88,1:17:02.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is of course why BBs are able to detect BTs
Dialogue: 0,1:17:02.85,1:17:08.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,and can show them to the operator that has them strapped to their bellies.
Dialogue: 0,1:17:08.08,1:17:10.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now while Kojima does have a lot of writing in here,
Dialogue: 0,1:17:10.34,1:17:15.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,that discusses the inherent value of human life even as a baby,
Dialogue: 0,1:17:15.04,1:17:16.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,he never really touches on the idea
Dialogue: 0,1:17:16.81,1:17:21.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,that you are literally taking an independent human as prisoner,
Dialogue: 0,1:17:21.41,1:17:24.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,and you're going to dispose of them once they're no longer useful
Dialogue: 0,1:17:24.93,1:17:27.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,As Deadman says, it's a tool.
Dialogue: 4,1:17:31.11,1:17:32.68,辉中 Script,,0,0,0,,因为我和它是搭档啊。
Dialogue: 4,1:17:33.74,1:17:34.71,辉中 Script,,0,0,0,,“搭档”？
Dialogue: 4,1:17:35.91,1:17:39.58,辉中 Script,,0,0,0,,山姆，BB是个工具，不是人类。
Dialogue: 4,1:17:40.52,1:17:42.87,辉中 Script,,0,0,0,,它是桥梁吗？是。是婴儿吗？不是。
Dialogue: 0,1:17:43.30,1:17:45.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,And they don't really explore this very much.
Dialogue: 0,1:17:45.50,1:17:47.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,They do touch on the idea pretty aggressively
Dialogue: 0,1:17:47.79,1:17:51.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,that the BB is becoming sentient, the BB is becoming human.
Dialogue: 0,1:17:51.39,1:17:55.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's going to start growing like a regular human very soon.
Dialogue: 0,1:17:55.05,1:17:58.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is of course why Deadman has to take the BB away from the player
Dialogue: 0,1:17:58.33,1:18:01.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,roughly halfway through the game in order to perform an operation
Dialogue: 0,1:18:01.39,1:18:03.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,to separate it from the humanity
Dialogue: 0,1:18:03.65,1:18:07.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,that's pulling it out of the world of the dead and closer to the world of the living.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:07.96,1:18:11.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this is what partially makes me think that Kojima had thought of this
Dialogue: 0,1:18:11.04,1:18:16.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,and simply decided to focus on the more pro-life discussion having to do with the BB's,
Dialogue: 0,1:18:16.54,1:18:22.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,the idea that these infants still have value as human life even though they're just infants.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:22.91,1:18:24.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,They're contained within a tank.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:24.25,1:18:28.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,They don't have much of anything by way of autonomy, but they still are valuable.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:28.35,1:18:30.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,So it could be that Kojima just decided
Dialogue: 0,1:18:30.53,1:18:35.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,that the discussion on slavery would have been too much and wasn't worth pursuing.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:35.77,1:18:40.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or maybe he just didn't think to add it in, I'm not entirely sure.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:40.22,1:18:43.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,Either way, it could have been cool to see him explore the idea
Dialogue: 0,1:18:43.28,1:18:47.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,of BBs being enslaved to a more powerful master,
Dialogue: 0,1:18:47.45,1:18:51.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,and not having any way of fighting it or claiming their own independence.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:51.86,1:18:53.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'm not really sure let, me know your thoughts below.
Dialogue: 0,1:18:53.90,1:18:56.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,Another thing that struck me is weird throughout the course of the story
Dialogue: 0,1:18:56.77,1:19:00.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,is the fact that they break the fourth wall all the time.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:00.21,1:19:02.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I'm not entirely sure why.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:02.06,1:19:06.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now of course you could say that this is just Kojima style and that's what he likes to do.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:06.17,1:19:08.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,So to judge it is simply unfair.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:08.80,1:19:13.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,However as I discussed earlier, the world that {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0} is taking place within
Dialogue: 0,1:19:13.03,1:19:18.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,has to be consistent and it has to live by its own rules, preferably, at all times.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:18.88,1:19:21.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,And for the most part it succeeds in this.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:21.46,1:19:25.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,The game seems to want players to be immersed at all times
Dialogue: 0,1:19:25.45,1:19:29.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,with the realistic graphics and the traversal system being very realistic.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:29.63,1:19:33.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,But at the same time, Sam breaks the fourth wall constantly.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:33.85,1:19:37.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,Though, in fairness, it is mostly relegated to the private room.
Dialogue: 0,1:19:37.74,1:19:39.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,It feels weird.

Dialogue: 0,1:20:03.39,1:20:05.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,It pulls the player out of the game.

Dialogue: 0,1:22:32.04,1:22:35.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,let's look at what your average mission is going to be comprised of.

Dialogue: 0,1:22:50.72,1:22:54.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now this is actually one of the more elaborate order types that you can get
Dialogue: 0,1:22:54.04,1:22:55.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it involves multiple stops.
Dialogue: 0,1:22:55.97,1:22:59.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,Simpler orders just give you items with the destination.
Dialogue: 0,1:22:59.41,1:23:03.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,So you accept the order and get told that you need to deliver the items quickly.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:03.28,1:23:07.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,And furthermore that the items that you're picking up are classified as "fragile",
Dialogue: 0,1:23:07.20,1:23:11.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,which means that you can't drop the packages, often you can't go in water, etc.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:11.77,1:23:14.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,Basically you have to be extra careful.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:14.10,1:23:16.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,You select your gear and load Sam up
Dialogue: 0,1:23:16.11,1:23:20.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,with any ladders, PCCs, climbing anchors, extra boots or weapons that you may need.

Dialogue: 0,1:23:23.21,1:23:27.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,In this case I'm not going to use any vehicles because we're going through a mountainous area
Dialogue: 0,1:23:27.13,1:23:31.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they aren't particularly useful in this rocky snowy area.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:31.47,1:23:34.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is what would usually be considered a more difficult mission.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:34.78,1:23:37.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,Specifically because it's in the snowy mountainous area.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:37.72,1:23:40.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,Not once in my over 100 hours with {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,1:23:40.78,1:23:44.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,did I encounter a mission where I failed the time limit.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:44.18,1:23:47.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,The only time I had any difficulty was when the items were fragile,
Dialogue: 0,1:23:47.62,1:23:51.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,or when I was completing multiple orders all at once,
Dialogue: 0,1:23:51.31,1:23:54.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,loading up with four or five orders at a given time.
Dialogue: 0,1:23:54.37,1:23:57.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so the way that the game dynamically alters the difficulty
Dialogue: 0,1:23:57.96,1:24:00.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,is with the routes that they'll have you do.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:00.17,1:24:03.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is why long routes tend to reward you with more likes
Dialogue: 0,1:24:03.71,1:24:06.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,and routes that go into the mountains also do the same.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:06.82,1:24:11.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now you can unlock certain items that makes node-traversal and mountain traversal easier,
Dialogue: 0,1:24:11.47,1:24:15.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,for instance, lots of ladders, climbing anchors that you can level up,
Dialogue: 0,1:24:15.01,1:24:18.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,power gloves, the all-terrain exoskeleton,
Dialogue: 0,1:24:18.13,1:24:21.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,and of course the zip-lines which you can use to set up routes
Dialogue: 0,1:24:21.13,1:24:23.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,after you've initially explored them.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:23.40,1:24:27.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,So with all this in mind I continued hiking, eventually I reached a cliff top,
Dialogue: 0,1:24:27.89,1:24:33.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,where I could have just dropped a ladder or a climbing anchor to descend and then cross by foot.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:33.01,1:24:37.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I happen to know that this area is infested with BTs.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:37.19,1:24:41.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,So I decided to build a zip-line which allowed me to completely skip this area,
Dialogue: 0,1:24:41.86,1:24:45.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,which effectively skips five to ten minutes of navigation.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:45.85,1:24:50.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,Don't worry, we're gonna go into a lot of detail with these zip-lines in just a bit.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:50.18,1:24:52.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,I reach to the bottom and continue hiking.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:52.31,1:24:56.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,Eventually I pick up the items, and then the entire process repeats as you're return.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:56.24,1:25:01.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now when you drop off the items you are graded on the condition that the packages are in.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:01.46,1:25:05.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,This can be both the quality of the outside container,
Dialogue: 0,1:25:05.74,1:25:08.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,in addition to the quality of the internal item
Dialogue: 0,1:25:08.99,1:25:11.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,which can experience damage if you aren't careful.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:11.58,1:25:15.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,For instance, if you fall off of a ladder, you'll fall, take damage,
Dialogue: 0,1:25:15.47,1:25:18.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,and the packages will be worth less when they're eventually delivered.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:18.63,1:25:20.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,There are however ways to deal with this.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:20.76,1:25:23.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,For instance with the timefall shelters if you stay in them
Dialogue: 0,1:25:23.48,1:25:25.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,and especially once they're upgraded,
Dialogue: 0,1:25:25.50,1:25:28.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,they'll actually repair your items as you stand underneath them.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:28.82,1:25:32.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,There of course also the cargo repair sprays which you can carry on your back.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:32.49,1:25:34.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,But this is basically it.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:34.12,1:25:38.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,There isn't much more to the gameplay system other than this.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:38.01,1:25:43.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,I know it may come as a surprise, but {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0} is not a third-person shooter.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:43.46,1:25:47.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's also not a monster fighting focused game,
Dialogue: 0,1:25:47.03,1:25:51.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,which means that all of the combat encounters that you'll experience are pretty clunky.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:51.86,1:25:56.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I don't know about you but every time I went to one of these flashback sequences with cliff,
Dialogue: 0,1:25:56.91,1:25:59.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,I was really excited, because they're very visually impressive.

Dialogue: 0,1:26:03.87,1:26:06.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's very interesting visually.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:06.34,1:26:11.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,But once you actually engage with the gameplay, you realize that it's just a shooting gallery,
Dialogue: 0,1:26:11.81,1:26:14.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's not a particularly difficult one.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:14.40,1:26:18.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,Even on the hardest possible difficulty, it doesn't change much.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:18.23,1:26:22.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,Really, as long as you're keeping cover and shooting the enemies when they appear,
Dialogue: 0,1:26:22.12,1:26:24.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is all the time, you're gonna be fine.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:24.51,1:26:27.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now as you would expect with the story, the game heavily encourages

Dialogue: 0,1:26:32.52,1:26:34.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,that you're only using non-lethal means.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:34.52,1:26:38.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,For this reason, they include non-lethal assault rifles,
Dialogue: 0,1:26:38.76,1:26:43.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,which basically completely negates the difficulty that would have been put in place
Dialogue: 0,1:26:43.45,1:26:46.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,by having a non-lethal requirement.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:46.21,1:26:52.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,Basically, these are still guns, they just don't finish the opponent in a death state.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:52.74,1:26:58.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,Instead, they're in an incapacitated state, which allows you to just continue on your merry way.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:58.77,1:27:02.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't know why they did this because it seems to undermine their own pursuit

Dialogue: 0,1:27:07.16,1:27:12.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,The player needs to have non-lethal means of interacting with enemies such as the MULEs

Dialogue: 0,1:27:15.20,1:27:20.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,But instead, you just use assault rifles that incapacitate them,
Dialogue: 0,1:27:20.33,1:27:25.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,which completely eliminates any gameplay difficulty that would have been there
Dialogue: 0,1:27:25.48,1:27:29.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,as a result of taking a stealth approach or a peaceful approach.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:29.17,1:27:32.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,But rest assured, this idea of the game undoing itself
Dialogue: 0,1:27:32.73,1:27:35.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,is something we're going to talk about much more in just a moment.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:35.47,1:27:40.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,But while discussing these deliveries, it's also important to discuss the map design.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:40.20,1:27:45.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now in my mind this is probably the most important game design element that is here.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:45.42,1:27:50.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,The mechanics of walking balancing, and using vehicles can all be fantastically well-designed.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:50.84,1:27:55.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,But if the world itself is not worthy of being explored, nobody's gonna care.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:55.67,1:27:56.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now like I said before,
Dialogue: 0,1:27:56.95,1:28:02.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,there are very FEW inherent reasons to explore the world of {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0}.

Dialogue: 0,1:28:14.33,1:28:16.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,For instance, in {\i1}Red Dead Redemption 2{\i0},
Dialogue: 0,1:28:16.19,1:28:21.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,there are all sorts of dynamic encounters that you can either choose to interact with or not.
Dialogue: 0,1:28:21.44,1:28:26.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the world is littered with them which means that every time you go out to explore the world,

Dialogue: 0,1:28:29.31,1:28:33.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's one of the reasons the world of {\i1}Red Dead Redemption 2{\i0} feels so alive.

Dialogue: 0,1:42:30.68,1:42:35.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now to me it seems pretty clearly that it's the former, not the latter.

Dialogue: 0,1:43:11.86,1:43:16.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it doesn't seem as though it's hidden in a way that encourages you to explore the map.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:16.19,1:43:21.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's hidden in a way, that encourages this busywork type of gameplay.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:21.01,1:43:22.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is another one that I'm actually okay with.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:22.87,1:43:25.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's hidden in an underpass by Mama's base.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:25.55,1:43:28.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is something that I did stumble on too while exploring.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:28.30,1:43:31.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,I didn't have to read any email cueing me to this area.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:31.61,1:43:34.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,So obviously I'm okay with this one.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:34.09,1:43:37.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is one I'm not okay with, it's on the hood of a semi Shore.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:37.29,1:43:40.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's outside of an area you're going to be trafficking fairly frequently,

Dialogue: 0,1:43:45.54,1:43:49.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,So the only reason you would hop up on this is if you scanned it,
Dialogue: 0,1:43:49.07,1:43:51.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,happen to spot it, and jumped up to grab it.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:51.69,1:43:56.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's no reason for the player to be looking up here or looking for memory chips in this area.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:56.60,1:44:01.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is something that you would just stumble onto, or would find if you were cued on to it.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:01.48,1:44:04.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's this one in the back corner of the loading zone room.

Dialogue: 0,1:44:06.43,1:44:10.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now fair enough, if you go back here, you're going to spot it, so it's fairly easy to find.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:10.69,1:44:16.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, the player has no reason to ever go back into one of these areas.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:16.24,1:44:21.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's just placed here, and you're expected to figure that out for reasons,

Dialogue: 0,1:44:23.58,1:44:26.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,placed in these back corners in any of the other loading zones.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:26.73,1:44:30.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's this one in the snow field, just sitting on top of a collapsed pillar.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:30.19,1:44:33.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is one that you would probably find during normal gameplay,
Dialogue: 0,1:44:33.23,1:44:36.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially because this is a BT heavy area,
Dialogue: 0,1:44:36.23,1:44:40.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,and this is a zone where you're going to be crouching and stealth in your way through.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:40.30,1:44:42.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,So I'm actually ok with this one, this one makes sense.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:42.84,1:44:47.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,This one's in a cave and this cave is actually marked with a ton of signs as a timefall shelter.
Dialogue: 0,1:44:47.79,1:44:50.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,So it's also likely that you would probably encounter this one

Dialogue: 0,1:44:53.07,1:44:58.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the one I like by far, the most, is the one hidden in Higgs' secret room.

Dialogue: 0,1:45:01.56,1:45:03.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's basically Higgs' center of operations.

Dialogue: 0,1:45:07.24,1:45:09.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is really cool that they included this here,
Dialogue: 0,1:45:09.45,1:45:14.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,even if some of the quotes scribbled on the wall are kind of … funny and … weird.

Dialogue: 0,1:45:17.45,1:45:22.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I really wish there were more things like this, hidden and scattered throughout the map.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:22.75,1:45:25.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,If the map were littered with things such as this,
Dialogue: 0,1:45:25.23,1:45:29.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,the player would have a reason and an excuse to explore for the sake of exploring

Dialogue: 0,1:45:31.65,1:45:34.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,Just going through the world for the sake of interacting with it.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:34.72,1:45:38.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,But at last, as far as I'm aware, this is the only thing like it in the game.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:38.60,1:45:42.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now it's pretty clear to me that these are supposed to be hunted down
Dialogue: 0,1:45:42.11,1:45:46.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,with emails that you receive in the game, which is obviously true.
Dialogue: 0,1:45:46.35,1:45:49.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because many of these chips won't actually spawn

Dialogue: 0,1:45:52.67,1:45:57.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,So clearly they want you to be interacting with the emails, and using the emails to find them.

Dialogue: 0,1:52:51.62,1:52:54.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,You see once you set up a few zip-line routes,

Dialogue: 0,1:53:28.07,1:53:31.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think Kojima Productions was actually aware of this
Dialogue: 0,1:53:31.09,1:53:33.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,and became aware of it at least later in development,
Dialogue: 0,1:53:33.70,1:53:37.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why they added the Chiral bandwidth system in in the first place.
Dialogue: 0,1:53:37.54,1:53:41.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because they realized if they allowed players to just build zip-lines everywhere,
Dialogue: 0,1:53:41.81,1:53:48.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,it would completely negate the need for crafting roads, building ladders, bridges, everything.
Dialogue: 0,1:53:48.46,1:53:51.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now the obvious defense of these zip-lines as they are
Dialogue: 0,1:53:51.52,1:53:55.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,is that they're going to force players to appreciate the work of other players
Dialogue: 0,1:53:55.61,1:53:58.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,that you're going to use online zip-lines
Dialogue: 0,1:53:58.02,1:54:02.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,in addition to the zip-lines your crafting paired with the chiral bandwidth system

Dialogue: 0,1:58:09.61,1:58:12.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is, that as the player becomes more powerful,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:12.94,1:58:17.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,they become less reliant on the gear and the items that you have been given,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:17.51,1:58:20.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,again, undermining those very items.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:20.26,1:58:22.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I want to shift gears a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:22.28,1:58:27.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,and talk about the broader implication of {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0} as Kojima described it.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:27.38,1:58:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,He said the {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0} was going to become

Dialogue: 0,1:58:33.89,1:58:36.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,In my opinion, he didn't do this.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:36.41,1:58:39.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,Effectively the idea was that the world was going to be shared,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:39.48,1:58:43.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least in terms of the items that players will put in the world to share.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:43.73,1:58:47.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now don't get me wrong, the Chiral Network and shared items are cool,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:47.58,1:58:50.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,but it doesn't actually feel like a revolution,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:50.21,1:58:53.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least I think in the way that Kojima intended.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:53.27,1:58:57.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,Sure, it's helpful to have a zip-line already built in an area,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:57.32,1:59:01.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,but the developers limited the number of items that can be placed in a particular zone,
Dialogue: 0,1:59:01.60,1:59:03.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,so that it never feels particularly crowded.
Dialogue: 0,1:59:03.95,1:59:07.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,And in concept, this is pretty simple and straightforward.
Dialogue: 0,1:59:07.17,1:59:11.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a world that's shared, but you can't actually see or find other players.
Dialogue: 0,1:59:11.72,1:59:14.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,You only see traces of them, which makes you dependent on them.
Dialogue: 0,1:59:14.97,1:59:18.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the game actually tries to turn this into some sort of profound statement,
Dialogue: 0,1:59:18.70,1:59:22.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I think it's just an attempt at explaining why other players are absent.

Dialogue: 0,2:00:02.86,2:00:07.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,And honestly having this in mind, why not have other players visible and present.
Dialogue: 0,2:00:07.83,2:00:12.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,You could give them other skins, so that they don't look like Sam to avoid griefing.
Dialogue: 0,2:00:12.23,2:00:14.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,And even have their movements recorded,
Dialogue: 0,2:00:14.36,2:00:19.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then played back in your world at a later time to prevent griefing nauseam.
Dialogue: 0,2:00:19.82,2:00:23.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,This would be similar to what racing games do when you race against your friends

Dialogue: 0,2:00:26.35,2:00:28.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,This could make it so as you explore the world,
Dialogue: 0,2:00:28.37,2:00:30.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,you're actually seeing other Porter's delivering stuff.

Dialogue: 0,2:00:47.96,2:00:52.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,this is not anywhere near on the level of having truly interactable players
Dialogue: 0,2:00:52.15,2:00:53.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least in my opinion.
Dialogue: 0,2:00:53.33,2:00:57.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is, they could have fully realized multiplayer systems in {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0},
Dialogue: 0,2:00:57.98,2:01:00.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it wouldn't have disrupted the story or the gameplay.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:00.74,2:01:02.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,So, why didn't they?
Dialogue: 0,2:01:02.96,2:01:06.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,Well it could have been technical, it could have been monetarily determined,
Dialogue: 0,2:01:06.13,2:01:10.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,it could have been that they didn't want to advertise it as an online game,
Dialogue: 0,2:01:10.00,2:01:14.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,it could have been that they were avoiding the PlayStation Plus requirement for online play,
Dialogue: 0,2:01:14.24,2:01:16.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that would have gone over the line.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:16.64,2:01:21.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or it could have been simply that Kojima wanted the world to be empty.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:21.10,2:01:25.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,Obviously, he stripped it of other life like the birds and the deer that we see in the opening,
Dialogue: 0,2:01:25.69,2:01:29.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,so maybe he meant all this to be empty, and lifeless.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:29.37,2:01:31.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, Kojima Syndrome.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:31.52,2:01:36.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think could have really added to the game even just to have AI controlled NPCs
Dialogue: 0,2:01:36.25,2:01:39.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,wandering the wastes and delivering packages constantly.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:39.78,2:01:43.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,You pass them on trails, you can speak with them, you can trade with them.

Dialogue: 0,2:01:48.74,2:01:52.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,It could have made the world feel more alive, again, worth saving.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:52.76,2:01:54.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this is my primary point of the section.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:54.85,2:01:59.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,If this new genre of game is supposed to bring people together,
Dialogue: 0,2:01:59.15,2:02:02.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's ironic that it's done the exact opposite.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:02.33,2:02:05.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,But all of this, thoroughly convinces me that
Dialogue: 0,2:02:05.41,2:02:09.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,this game was on a strict budget, and even was rushed out the door.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:09.81,2:02:11.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,Allow me to argue my point.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:11.49,2:02:13.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,To me it seems pretty clear.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:13.16,2:02:15.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,Animals were cut from the game.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:15.72,2:02:20.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,They went through the trouble of modeling and animating them for the opening sequence.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:20.01,2:02:22.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,They must have been in the game at some point.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:22.63,2:02:25.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,And they were completely cut later in development
Dialogue: 0,2:02:25.35,2:02:29.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,when it became clear that they were going to be too tedious to place carefully in the world,
Dialogue: 0,2:02:29.99,2:02:35.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,or perhaps they were making the world feel too alive, and it didn't feel like an apocalypse.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:35.02,2:02:37.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,Either way, it looks as though they were cut.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:37.50,2:02:43.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,And PC interactions after orders are almost all holographic and look objectively terrible.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:43.50,2:02:48.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,These are all copy and pasted with different skins effectively and new voice actors,
Dialogue: 0,2:02:48.91,2:02:50.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,but they're all the same.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:50.93,2:02:54.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,Bridges and Fragile housings buildings and environments
Dialogue: 0,2:02:54.60,2:02:57.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,are all copy and pasted across the entire game.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:57.43,2:03:01.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,Very few vehicles, especially considering the variability of locations,
Dialogue: 0,2:03:01.78,2:03:06.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,snowy areas, rocky areas, River covered areas they're all highly variable.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:06.78,2:03:11.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the vehicles that are there to offer transportation across these

Dialogue: 0,2:03:13.23,2:03:16.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,There are areas on the outskirts of the map in the central area
Dialogue: 0,2:03:16.45,2:03:19.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,which are all glitchy and frankly terrible.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:19.23,2:03:21.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,It shows that they put a lot of effort
Dialogue: 0,2:03:21.73,2:03:26.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,in polishing the central areas in the heavily trafficked areas, which is fair enough.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:26.81,2:03:31.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it shows that there's a real lack of polish all over this game.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:31.12,2:03:32.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,You just have to know where to look.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:32.79,2:03:35.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,And all of this is too bad because it does really make you wonder

Dialogue: 0,2:03:37.33,2:03:42.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,if Kojima were given another year or so to work on it and a lot more money.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:42.12,2:03:47.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,But that brings us to the question of Kojima's strengths and weaknesses,
Dialogue: 0,2:03:47.18,2:03:49.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,which, no doubt, there are plenty.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:49.76,2:03:51.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,I figured what better way
Dialogue: 0,2:03:51.33,2:03:55.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,to end this critique of {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0} than to discuss the man himself.
Dialogue: 0,2:03:55.97,2:04:00.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,You see Kojima does whatever he wants whenever he wants to.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:00.69,2:04:03.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,That's kind of the whole point of him leaving Konami,
Dialogue: 0,2:04:03.29,2:04:05.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,is that now he is completely free.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:05.51,2:04:08.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,However after playing through {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0}, I can't help but feel as though
Dialogue: 0,2:04:08.85,2:04:13.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,he desperately needs a dramaturg, or a co-director, to keep him in check.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:13.77,2:04:16.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,I feel as though through the course of this video I've outlined a lot of reasons
Dialogue: 0,2:04:16.89,2:04:19.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,why Kojima needs to be restrained
Dialogue: 0,2:04:19.25,2:04:23.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,and needs to have somebody to deal with him in a much more mature way.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:23.51,2:04:27.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because I honestly don't think he knows when to stop or when he's being ridiculous.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:27.96,2:04:30.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,I could point to things such as the fourth wall breaks,
Dialogue: 0,2:04:30.41,2:04:34.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,all of the product placement, for AMC, and Monster Energy drinks.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:34.13,2:04:38.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's a lot of really bad plot twists and a lot of the writing in here is so wordy.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:38.31,2:04:42.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's hard to even follow what Kojima is trying to communicate.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:42.19,2:04:46.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I took a playwriting class a couple of years ago, and it was really interesting.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:46.38,2:04:50.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,But one of the things that the teacher said on the first day of class
Dialogue: 0,2:04:50.20,2:04:54.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,was that new writers tend to write A LOT,
Dialogue: 0,2:04:54.02,2:04:57.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,whereas experienced writers tend to write WELL.
Dialogue: 0,2:04:57.89,2:05:02.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I couldn't help but feel as though Kojima is a new writer.
Dialogue: 0,2:05:02.23,2:05:07.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,He seems to just throw all of the spaghetti at the wall just hoping something sticks.
Dialogue: 0,2:05:07.22,2:05:10.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,So instead of writing a monologue that's three sentences long,
Dialogue: 0,2:05:10.84,2:05:13.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,he'll write one that's 15 minutes long,
Dialogue: 0,2:05:13.32,2:05:16.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,and hope that you get something more significant from that.
Dialogue: 0,2:05:16.34,2:05:19.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think it shows a certain amount of insecurity in his writing
Dialogue: 0,2:05:19.10,2:05:24.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,that he feels as though he can't communicate in as short a time as a lot of other writers could,
Dialogue: 0,2:05:24.48,2:05:27.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,such as Neil Druckmann, who wrote {\i1}The Last Of Us{\i0}, {\i1}Uncharted 4{\i0},

Dialogue: 0,2:05:35.97,2:05:39.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it was a humble and confident Kojima.

Dialogue: 0,2:05:43.75,2:05:48.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, I like humble Kojima more than this new one.

Dialogue: 0,2:06:11.43,2:06:13.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,but he fails to see criticism for what it is,
Dialogue: 0,2:06:13.49,2:06:15.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,and his fans think he can do no wrong.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:15.54,2:06:19.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,He needed others to reign in his vision to make it more appealing.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:19.08,2:06:22.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,He knows exactly what he wants to make and he doesn't waver.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:22.30,2:06:25.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,He's an innovator, but not a hands-down genius.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:25.24,2:06:28.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,He presents the most unique ideas for world building and characters,
Dialogue: 0,2:06:28.47,2:06:31.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,despite falling on rather generic writing tropes.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:31.17,2:06:35.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,He's an excellent designer with ideas he doesn't know how to clearly express.

Dialogue: 0,2:06:46.30,2:06:49.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now all of this seems to coalesce into a consensus
Dialogue: 0,2:06:49.29,2:06:54.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,that he is a talented artist with a lot of really interesting original ideas.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:54.51,2:06:57.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,But that he doesn't know when to stop and to delegate.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:57.73,2:07:00.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,For instance, he has an original story idea,
Dialogue: 0,2:07:00.34,2:07:06.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,but he insists on writing out the macro, and the micro story elements himself,
Dialogue: 0,2:07:06.40,2:07:10.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,despite being objectively bad at writing dialogue.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:10.39,2:07:13.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's really too bad, because if {\i1}Death Stranding{\i0} were more lean,
