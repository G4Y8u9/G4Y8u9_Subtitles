Dialogue: 1,0:00:30.76,0:00:36.63,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,唯一的问题是它已经咕了14年了，预算也超了十倍
Dialogue: 2,0:00:30.76,0:00:36.63,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,The only problem is that it's now 14 years late and about 10 times over budget
Dialogue: 1,0:00:36.63,0:00:40.50,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,而且已经推迟到2021年才发射
Dialogue: 2,0:00:36.63,0:00:40.50,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,and still won't be launched until 2021
Dialogue: 1,0:00:40.98,0:00:43.56,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,所以为什么我们不能让哈勃无限连任？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:40.98,0:00:43.56,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,So why can't we keep Hubble going?
Dialogue: 1,0:00:43.94,0:00:48.78,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,JWST又为什么延期如此之久且造价如此之高呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:43.94,0:00:48.78,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,And why is the JWST so late and so expensive

Dialogue: 1,0:01:22.26,0:01:27.52,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,115,,还出现了形状上的偏差，说白了哈勃近视眼了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:22.26,0:01:27.52,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,80,,had been made with a tiny error in its shape effectively making it short-sighted

Dialogue: 2,0:01:27.90,0:01:34.20,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,80,,It took a further three years before a fix was created to finally get it working as it should
Dialogue: 1,0:01:34.92,0:01:38.22,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,哈勃本身设计就是可以在轨维护升级
Dialogue: 2,0:01:34.92,0:01:38.22,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,The Hubble was designed to be serviced and upgraded in orbit
Dialogue: 1,0:01:38.34,0:01:43.18,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,过去25年里它进行了5次维护
Dialogue: 2,0:01:38.34,0:01:43.18,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,and over the last 25 years it has undergone five service missions
Dialogue: 1,0:01:43.64,0:01:45.86,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,这些任务全部是由航天飞机完成的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:43.64,0:01:45.86,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,This was all done using the Space Shuttle
Dialogue: 1,0:01:46.00,0:01:51.00,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,并且在每次维护结束后，航天飞机都会把哈勃推向更高的轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:01:46.00,0:01:51.00,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,and at the end of each mission the shuttle would move the Hubble to a higher orbit
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.64,0:01:55.44,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,这样做的目的在于，虽然哈勃望远镜是在太空中运行
Dialogue: 2,0:01:51.64,0:01:55.44,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,This is done because although Hubble is in orbit in space
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.60,0:02:01.68,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,但它的轨道还是太低了，仍然能够触及大气最上层极其微薄的空气
Dialogue: 2,0:01:55.60,0:02:01.68,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,the height of this orbit is still low enough to be in the very, very thin upper atmosphere
Dialogue: 1,0:02:01.80,0:02:05.78,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,而这会产生阻力，逐渐降低其速度
Dialogue: 2,0:02:01.80,0:02:05.78,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,And this creates drag which slows it down over time
Dialogue: 1,0:02:06.22,0:02:10.80,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,速度慢了，轨道就会下降
Dialogue: 2,0:02:06.22,0:02:10.80,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,This slowing down causes the orbit to decay and become lower
Dialogue: 1,0:02:11.28,0:02:14.64,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,轨道下降，阻力又会变大，速度继续变慢
Dialogue: 2,0:02:11.28,0:02:14.64,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,which increases the drag which slows it down more
Dialogue: 1,0:02:14.64,0:02:17.80,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,进而继续下降，增加阻力……如此周而复始
Dialogue: 2,0:02:14.64,0:02:17.80,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,which makes it come lower which increases the drag and so on and so forth
Dialogue: 1,0:02:18.02,0:02:22.88,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,如果什么都不做，那它终将进入大气烧毁
Dialogue: 2,0:02:18.02,0:02:22.88,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,And if nothing is done then eventually it will crash back to earth and burn up
Dialogue: 1,0:02:23.40,0:02:29.14,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,2018年10月5日，哈勃在它的一个陀螺仪坏掉后进入了休眠模式

Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.34,0:02:33.94,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,陀螺仪作用是在轨调整并保持航天器姿态
Dialogue: 2,0:02:29.34,0:02:33.94,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,These are devices which are used to help guide and keep its orientation in orbit
Dialogue: 1,0:02:34.16,0:02:37.40,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,哈勃上有六个，坏了四个
Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.16,0:02:37.40,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,And although it does have six, four have now failed
Dialogue: 1,0:02:37.82,0:02:43.62,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,其中三个是旧款，这么长时间也该坏了，但这次坏的是新款
Dialogue: 2,0:02:37.82,0:02:43.62,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,Three of the six were an older design and that was to be expected but this was one of the newer design ones
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.22,0:02:49.86,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,虽说理想情况下需要三个来分别控制XYZ轴
Dialogue: 2,0:02:44.22,0:02:49.86,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,Although it ideally needs three to operate one for each axis the X Y & Z
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.06,0:02:54.38,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,但新的操控技术使它可以只使用一个
Dialogue: 2,0:02:50.06,0:02:54.38,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,new operational techniques mean that it can work with just one
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.74,0:02:57.36,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,作为哈勃维护任务的一部分
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.74,0:02:57.36,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,As part of the ongoing servicing of Hubble
Dialogue: 1,0:02:57.48,0:03:03.78,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,新型陀螺仪和一堆其他设备在前几次任务中都装了上去
Dialogue: 2,0:02:57.48,0:03:03.78,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,the newer design gyros along with a list of other equipment had been installed on a previous service mission
Dialogue: 1,0:03:04.14,0:03:09.00,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,但毕竟都是机械设备，总有一天会出故障
Dialogue: 2,0:03:04.14,0:03:09.00,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,but these are mechanical devices and as such they will wear out eventually
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.30,0:03:16.40,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,现在的问题是我们已经没有航天飞机去维护哈勃或者抬高其轨道了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.30,0:03:16.40,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,The problem is we no longer have a space shuttle to do any further service missions or boost Hubble's orbit
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.64,0:03:19.34,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,所以即使一切运转正常
Dialogue: 2,0:03:16.64,0:03:19.34,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,So even if nothing else goes wrong
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.58,0:03:25.12,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,哈勃也会在大约2028年到2040年之间落回地球
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.58,0:03:25.12,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,Hubble will eventually fall back to earth somewhere between 2028 and 2040
Dialogue: 1,0:03:25.34,0:03:31.84,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,这个估计范围如此大是因为太阳活动会影响到地球外围大气的密度
Dialogue: 2,0:03:25.34,0:03:31.84,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,This rather vague date is because it's the sun's activity that affects the expansion of the Earth's atmosphere
Dialogue: 1,0:03:31.88,0:03:34.94,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,最终会影响到哈勃受到的大气阻力
Dialogue: 2,0:03:31.88,0:03:34.94,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,and ultimately the atmospheric drag on Hubble
Dialogue: 1,0:03:35.28,0:03:38.68,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,所以我们只能估计到这种程度
Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.28,0:03:38.68,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,And that's something which we can only estimate into the future
Dialogue: 1,0:03:39.06,0:03:41.52,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,但原本计划并非如此
Dialogue: 2,0:03:39.06,0:03:41.52,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,But it wasn't planned to end like this
Dialogue: 1,0:03:41.76,0:03:46.32,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,原定计划之一就是用航天飞机把哈勃再带回来
Dialogue: 2,0:03:41.76,0:03:46.32,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,one of the scenarios was that the Hubble would be brought back to earth by the shuttle
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.42,0:03:49.62,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,放到类似美国国立博物馆之类的地方展出
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.42,0:03:49.62,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,and maybe placed somewhere like the Smithsonian Museum
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.40,0:03:54.86,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,要是说非要给它再续几年的话
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.40,0:03:54.86,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,If there is the political will Hubble's life could be extended

Dialogue: 2,0:03:55.14,0:04:00.10,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,80,,there has been talk of a commercial mission using a manned version of a Dream Chaser
Dialogue: 1,0:04:00.28,0:04:04.14,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,115,,去维护哈勃，并抬高它的轨道，以防万一——
Dialogue: 2,0:04:00.28,0:04:04.14,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,80,,to service Hubble and boost its orbit just in case
Dialogue: 1,0:04:04.32,0:04:07.60,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,——万一JWST又双叒叕延期
Dialogue: 2,0:04:04.32,0:04:07.60,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,there are further delays with the James Webb Space Telescope
Dialogue: 1,0:04:07.70,0:04:11.34,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,甚至万一JWST变成了一百亿美元的烟花（我呸）
Dialogue: 2,0:04:07.70,0:04:11.34,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,or god forbid but something happens to it during its launch
Dialogue: 1,0:04:11.60,0:04:18.08,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,但不管怎么说，目前我们真的没有任何能把哈勃带回来的载具
Dialogue: 2,0:04:11.60,0:04:18.08,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,But either way we now just don't have a vehicle that could bring the Hubble safely back to earth
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.80,0:04:24.04,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,回到JWST上，它又为什么连上天都这么费劲呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.80,0:04:24.04,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,But why is the James Webb taking so long to quite literally get off the ground
Dialogue: 1,0:04:24.52,0:04:28.07,1080CN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,原因之一是它的最终运行位置
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.52,0:04:28.07,1080EN_BELOW,,0,0,0,,Well one of the reasons is where it will take up its final position
