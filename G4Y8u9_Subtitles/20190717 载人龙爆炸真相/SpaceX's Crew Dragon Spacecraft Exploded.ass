Dialogue: 2,0:01:21.60,0:01:26.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,the super Draco thrusters are 3d printed bi-propellant pressure fed engines
Dialogue: 1,0:01:26.87,0:01:30.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,有燃料和氧化剂
Dialogue: 2,0:01:26.87,0:01:30.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means that it has a fuel and an oxidizer
Dialogue: 1,0:01:30.32,0:01:35.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,通过氦气加压 挤压进发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:01:30.32,0:01:35.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is forced into the engines by gas pressure from a helium tank
Dialogue: 1,0:01:35.30,0:01:39.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,超级天龙座的室压大约是60个大气压
Dialogue: 2,0:01:35.30,0:01:39.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,the chamber pressure on the super Draco's is about 60 atmospheres
Dialogue: 1,0:01:39.20,0:01:42.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以需要很高压的氦气罐
Dialogue: 2,0:01:39.20,0:01:42.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means you need quite a high pressure helium tank
Dialogue: 1,0:01:42.17,0:01:44.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,才能推动燃料和氧化剂
Dialogue: 2,0:01:42.17,0:01:44.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,to push the fuel and oxidizer through
Dialogue: 1,0:01:44.62,0:01:47.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,故障发生在发动机点火之前
Dialogue: 2,0:01:44.62,0:01:47.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,the anomaly happened just before engine ignition
Dialogue: 1,0:01:47.88,0:01:51.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,为了给系统加压 氦气阀门已经开启
Dialogue: 2,0:01:47.88,0:01:51.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,the helium valve had been opened to pressurize the system
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.15,0:01:54.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,但氧化剂和燃料阀门并未开启
Dialogue: 2,0:01:51.15,0:01:54.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the oxidizer and fuel valves had not yet opened
Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.36,0:01:57.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以燃料不会流进发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:01:54.36,0:01:57.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,and therefore fuel wouldn't be flowing into the engine
Dialogue: 1,0:01:57.20,0:02:00.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些阀门是根据指令需求才开启的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:57.20,0:02:00.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,now these valves open and close according to command
Dialogue: 1,0:02:00.22,0:02:02.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,但还有一组非常重要的阀门
Dialogue: 2,0:02:00.22,0:02:02.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,but there's another pair of valves in there that are very important
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.77,0:02:04.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,叫做止回阀
Dialogue: 2,0:02:02.77,0:02:04.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are automatic check valves
Dialogue: 1,0:02:04.80,0:02:08.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们只允许液体往一个方向流动
Dialogue: 2,0:02:04.80,0:02:08.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,they only flow allow fluid to flow in one direction
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.85,0:02:13.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,这非常重要 因为你不想让液体流回到装氦气的部分
Dialogue: 2,0:02:08.85,0:02:13.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is critically important because you don't want your liquids flowing back into your gas section
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.42,0:02:17.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,这会导致氦气流过的时候发生“打嗝”
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.42,0:02:17.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least might cause burping as the gas flows through the system
Dialogue: 1,0:02:17.55,0:02:22.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,更糟糕的是，左侧气体系统的管路是钛合金制造的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:17.55,0:02:22.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,even worse the piping in the gas system is titanium typically
Dialogue: 1,0:02:22.17,0:02:25.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而右侧燃料和氧化剂系统的管路
Dialogue: 2,0:02:22.17,0:02:25.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,and whereas the piping in the fuel and oxidiser system
Dialogue: 1,0:02:25.22,0:02:30.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,则是不锈钢材料 面对腐蚀性燃料更耐操
Dialogue: 2,0:02:25.22,0:02:30.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,is lightly to be stainless steel much more robust against the corrosive fuel
Dialogue: 1,0:02:30.25,0:02:32.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,止回阀是靠压力运作的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:30.25,0:02:32.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,check valves work based on pressure
Dialogue: 1,0:02:32.47,0:02:36.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,当液体从一边流向另一边时会推动阀门开启
Dialogue: 2,0:02:32.47,0:02:36.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you have a fluid flowing in one direction it pushes the valve open
Dialogue: 1,0:02:36.40,0:02:40.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,而反向流动的话会推动阀门关闭
Dialogue: 2,0:02:36.40,0:02:40.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the pressure is in the reverse direction it pushes the valve closed
Dialogue: 1,0:02:40.60,0:02:41.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而阻止逆流
Dialogue: 2,0:02:40.60,0:02:41.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it stops the flow
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.05,0:02:45.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而在测试中出现了些意外
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.05,0:02:45.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,however during the test something didn't work quite right 
Dialogue: 1,0:02:45.00,0:02:47.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许是发生在燃料加注时
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.00,0:02:47.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,and while it was being either with fuel was being loaded
Dialogue: 1,0:02:47.80,0:02:51.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,又或许是燃料氧化剂都加满以后在罐子里的时候
Dialogue: 2,0:02:47.80,0:02:51.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,or while it was just sitting around with their oxidizer in the tanks
Dialogue: 1,0:02:51.67,0:02:55.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,其中一部分逆流泄漏通过了止回阀
Dialogue: 2,0:02:51.67,0:02:55.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,some of that began to leak backwards through the check valve
Dialogue: 1,0:02:55.50,0:02:57.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上这不是没有先例的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:55.50,0:02:57.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,now this is actually not unprecedented
Dialogue: 1,0:02:57.92,0:03:03.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃料总会漏过去一点 会在氦气管道中有少量残留
Dialogue: 2,0:02:57.92,0:03:03.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,but anyway that would leak through and it collected at a low spot in the helium piping
Dialogue: 1,0:03:03.75,0:03:08.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后当氦气阀开启 氦气沿着左边的管道流经整个系统
Dialogue: 2,0:03:03.75,0:03:08.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,so when the helium valve was opened and the helium began to flow through the system
Dialogue: 1,0:03:08.60,0:03:14.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,而上面氧化剂那条路遇到了那一小块栓塞
Dialogue: 2,0:03:08.60,0:03:14.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the oxidizer loop it encountered this blob of fuel which was blocking the pipe
Dialogue: 1,0:03:14.15,0:03:18.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,当高压氦气遇到栓塞并推动其前进时
Dialogue: 2,0:03:14.15,0:03:18.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,and when that high pressure helium encountered that it pushed it along the pipe
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.00,0:03:21.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,会像子弹一样把它射出去
Dialogue: 2,0:03:18.00,0:03:21.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,exactly like a bullet is pushed down the barrel of a gun
Dialogue: 1,0:03:21.40,0:03:26.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,的确有像左边氦气系统那样高压的气步枪
Dialogue: 2,0:03:21.40,0:03:26.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,there are actually high-powered air rifles are nearly as high pressure as this helium system
Dialogue: 1,0:03:26.68,0:03:29.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,且因氦气的原子量小
Dialogue: 2,0:03:26.68,0:03:29.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,and helium because of its lower atomic mass
Dialogue: 1,0:03:29.40,0:03:31.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,移动速度会更快
Dialogue: 2,0:03:29.40,0:03:31.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually moves things even faster
Dialogue: 1,0:03:32.00,0:03:36.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,氧化剂栓塞会在几毫秒内通过左边的管路
Dialogue: 2,0:03:32.00,0:03:36.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,it takes milliseconds for that blob of oxidizer to find its way through the system
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.60,0:03:41.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,像子弹一样直冲止回阀
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.60,0:03:41.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and run into that one-way check valve with the force of a bullet
Dialogue: 1,0:03:41.12,0:03:46.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,不但其动能足以摧毁止回阀
Dialogue: 2,0:03:41.12,0:03:46.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,not only is the momentum and kinetic energy enough to shatter the valve components
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.07,0:03:50.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时四氧化二氮还是强氧化剂
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.07,0:03:50.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,but because dinitrogen tetroxide is a highly oxidizing material
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.95,0:03:54.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,且该系统的一些材料是可燃的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.95,0:03:54.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,and because some of the metals in the system are combustible
Dialogue: 1,0:03:54.37,0:04:00.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是产生了燃烧 摧毁了管路并起火
Dialogue: 2,0:03:54.37,0:04:00.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,this actually starts a metal fire so the pipe ruptures and the fire is started
Dialogue: 1,0:04:00.05,0:04:04.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,一旦开始 钛就会很猛烈地燃烧
Dialogue: 2,0:04:00.05,0:04:04.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,once it gets started titanium burns very very well
Dialogue: 1,0:04:04.42,0:04:06.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,从泄漏的视频中我们能看到
Dialogue: 2,0:04:04.42,0:04:06.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,now what we saw in that leaked video
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.65,0:04:11.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,最开始是一侧炸开 一股高压氦气冒出
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.65,0:04:11.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,was initially the side blowing off and a cloud of high pressure helium coming out
Dialogue: 1,0:04:11.62,0:04:14.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,而氦气就是加压让其快速移动的物质
Dialogue: 2,0:04:11.62,0:04:14.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,the helium is the thing that is pressurized it's moving fast
Dialogue: 1,0:04:14.72,0:04:18.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃料和氧化剂系统还未被加压
Dialogue: 2,0:04:14.72,0:04:18.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,the fuel and oxidizer system those haven't been properly pressurized
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.90,0:04:21.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以它们流出的速度会慢得多
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.90,0:04:21.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,so those will come out but they will come out a lot more slowly
Dialogue: 1,0:04:21.80,0:04:23.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个过程只有几秒
Dialogue: 2,0:04:21.80,0:04:23.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,it only takes a few seconds though
Dialogue: 1,0:04:23.77,0:04:26.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,有了燃烧 又有很多高能物质
Dialogue: 2,0:04:23.77,0:04:26.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you've got this fire and you've got a lot of high-energy events
Dialogue: 1,0:04:27.05,0:04:29.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,泄漏一开始就会产生燃烧
Dialogue: 2,0:04:27.05,0:04:29.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,and once that starts leaking you have a fire already
Dialogue: 1,0:04:29.97,0:04:32.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,而烧掉的不只是燃料
Dialogue: 2,0:04:29.97,0:04:32.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it will burn using not just the fuel
