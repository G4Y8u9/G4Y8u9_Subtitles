Dialogue: 2,0:04:20.46,0:04:24.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,But let's get into Gary Anderson's analysis of what Mercedes is doing.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:24.52,0:04:27.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,当F1赛车的后扩散器接近地面时
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.52,0:04:27.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,As the rear diffuser of an F1 car gets closer to the ground,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:27.82,0:04:30.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,通过底板主要平坦部分下方的气流
Dialogue: 2,0:04:27.82,0:04:30.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,the airflow passing under the main flat part of the floor
Dialogue: 1,0:04:30.67,0:04:34.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,无法快速通过 无法正常供给扩散器
Dialogue: 2,0:04:30.67,0:04:34.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,can't move fast enough through there to feed the diffuser properly.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:34.56,0:04:38.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致尾部气流失速 赛车下压力降低 阻力降低
Dialogue: 2,0:04:34.56,0:04:38.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,This means the air flow stalls and the car loses down force and therefore drag,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:38.95,0:04:40.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,这在直道上是很有优势的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.95,0:04:40.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is very handy on the straights.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:41.18,0:04:45.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,优化这种效果还有一个额外的好处 即能够使用更多的尾翼
Dialogue: 2,0:04:41.18,0:04:45.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Optimizing this effect comes with the additional advantage of being able to run more rear wing,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:45.85,0:04:51.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,赛车在弯道有更高的下压力 又能因尾部扩散器气流失速而兼顾直道速度
Dialogue: 2,0:04:45.85,0:04:49.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means more grip through the corners, but still with the straight line speed you need,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:49.61,0:04:51.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the diffuser stalls.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:52.27,0:04:54.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是所有车队共同的设计目标
Dialogue: 2,0:04:52.27,0:04:54.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,That makes it a common objective.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:54.73,0:04:58.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这对梅奔来说特别重要的原因是他们与阿斯顿·马丁的赛车
Dialogue: 2,0:04:54.73,0:04:58.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason this is of particular valley to Mercedes is that along with Aston Martin,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:58.84,0:05:01.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,都是围场里的低倾角底板赛车
Dialogue: 2,0:04:58.84,0:05:01.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,it has one of the two low rake cars on the grid.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:02.06,0:05:05.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,也就是说梅奔的赛车后部本来就已经很接近地面了

Dialogue: 1,0:06:51.77,0:06:55.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为气弹簧的几何形状让它也"过中"了
Dialogue: 2,0:06:51.77,0:06:55.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's because the geometry of the gas strut goes "over center".
