Dialogue: 0,0:19:40.48,0:19:44.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is not symmetric,  but we're able to do that now,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.00,0:19:47.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,because the engineering analysis tools are better.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:48.14,0:19:51.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so Vulcan switches to orthogrid, takes about half

Dialogue: 0,0:19:56.42,0:19:58.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,so as I look along the orothogrid
Dialogue: 0,0:19:58.42,0:20:00.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,here, so
Dialogue: 0,0:20:00.42,0:20:02.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,you're gonna break it along the long side
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.42,0:20:04.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,so this is gonna be a really long skinny

Dialogue: 0,0:20:07.26,0:20:10.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,So what happens when you're breaking along that line?
Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.28,0:20:12.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because you have a section in the middle of the webbing

Dialogue: 0,0:20:20.86,0:20:23.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,So actually the way the break process works
Dialogue: 0,0:20:23.66,0:20:25.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,is we'll bring it in flat,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:25.60,0:20:30.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,and as we break it, we're moving just a small amount of material each time
Dialogue: 0,0:20:30.26,0:20:32.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,and we roll the part in and out,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:32.26,0:20:35.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,so the amount of strain and work hardening that we get
Dialogue: 0,0:20:35.04,0:20:37.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,is actually very uniform across that width
Dialogue: 0,0:20:37.68,0:20:38.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,-Okay. Got it.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:38.72,0:20:41.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the issue that you brought up is one of the reasons
Dialogue: 0,0:20:41.72,0:20:44.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,why that's done by people. It's a hand operation.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:45.12,0:20:48.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,So there's no CNC on the curving of the brake press,

Dialogue: 0,0:21:06.66,0:21:09.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,-And so, the orthogrid, just looking at it,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:09.68,0:21:12.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,the webbing looks thinner, so it looks like it's much more light-weight.

Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.16,0:21:16.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,Are you allowed to tell me a percentage?

Dialogue: 0,0:21:19.60,0:21:24.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it is absolutely lighter weight and stronger than the old isogrid design.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:24.82,0:21:26.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it takes half as long to make.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:26.98,0:21:29.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,-Why does it take less time to make?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:29.92,0:21:32.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,You can see how much simpler that pattern is,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:33.18,0:21:37.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,So the CNC machine has more straight runs in a simpler pattern,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:38.12,0:21:41.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it just... it's that much faster to machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:41.70,0:21:44.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,So those are fancy space saw horses?
Dialogue: 0,0:21:44.68,0:21:45.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,Yes they are, yeah.

Dialogue: 0,0:22:23.16,0:22:26.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,So you can see that these guys actually have

Dialogue: 0,0:22:29.22,0:22:31.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,we're going to actually take that out.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:31.70,0:22:34.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,That helps up form the curvature along this axis,

Dialogue: 0,0:32:23.48,0:32:28.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,when you weld something, usually you tack it together all around the perimeter
Dialogue: 0,0:32:28.76,0:32:32.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,before you do the final welding, because the heat will draw it up

Dialogue: 0,0:32:42.22,0:32:44.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,is because you don't melt any material.

Dialogue: 0,0:46:02.30,0:46:06.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,And when we actually put the domes on it, we'll have to grab it at either end and stretch it,

Dialogue: 0,0:46:25.42,0:46:28.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,So you have axial stress and you have ring stress, ring stress is the problem here.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:28.82,0:46:33.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,-So you could think of it as a longitudinal buckling problem if you want,
Dialogue: 0,0:46:33.62,0:46:37.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,because the weight of the structure itself would overcome the stiffness,
Dialogue: 0,0:46:37.90,0:46:42.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it would--you'd start with a hoop and it would just kinda buckle like this on the top and fold in.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:42.46,0:46:47.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,-Gotcha, awesome. But we have the same friction stir welding idea there?
Dialogue: 0,0:46:47.20,0:46:51.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,No, so this material is so thin that you cannot friction stir weld it.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:52.68,0:46:57.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,So this is all done with resistance arc welding instead, and on Centaur III,
Dialogue: 0,0:46:57.72,0:46:59.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is what we fly on Atlas today,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:00.84,0:47:04.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,this is a labor-intensive operation. 180,000 welds,

Dialogue: 0,0:47:06.26,0:47:11.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,so it takes many many hours and quite a bit of time to build this sort of "Ferrari" of an upper-stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:12.04,0:47:15.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,-Yeah. Vulcan will be robotic and automated.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:15.08,0:47:16.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,-Really, that's amazing.

Dialogue: 0,0:47:19.92,0:47:22.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,the engine--well there's not a dome on the back, that's where the engine goes.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:22.44,0:47:26.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,-So there will actually be a dome, so that you have a sump to collect propellant in
Dialogue: 0,0:47:26.34,0:47:30.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,to draw it into the engine, so you don't waste as much propellant,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:30.26,0:47:33.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,and what you can't see on the inside is a bulkhead, to separate

Dialogue: 0,0:47:50.88,0:47:53.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,so there's a final assembly that gets done in a clean room. -Okay
Dialogue: 0,0:47:53.24,0:47:56.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,And that's the best place, so we'll look down, you'll see a whole bunch of them,

Dialogue: 0,0:47:58.92,0:48:02.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this is the final assembly area for Centaur,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:02.44,0:48:04.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,this is a clean room, that's why we're up here,

Dialogue: 0,0:49:07.16,0:49:13.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,We do, yeah so the booster's job is to get you into space, typically depending on the payload
Dialogue: 0,0:49:13.24,0:49:16.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,but typically you're not quite orbital at the end of first stage burn,
Dialogue: 0,0:49:16.90,0:49:21.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then Centaur will take you orbital, bring you to your parking orbit,
Dialogue: 0,0:49:21.36,0:49:26.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then once you're lined up correctly with, you know the right sort of argument, of

Dialogue: 0,0:49:32.62,0:49:35.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,and in this case it's interplanetary missions, so we're going out to Mars.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:36.20,0:49:40.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,-So, the brains that drives the Centaur, where is that at?

Dialogue: 0,0:49:43.40,0:49:47.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,We are. So on the back end of that is a flight controls computer,

Dialogue: 0,0:49:50.98,0:49:56.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,uh rate sensors that are the guidance system; they're always attached to the upper stage
