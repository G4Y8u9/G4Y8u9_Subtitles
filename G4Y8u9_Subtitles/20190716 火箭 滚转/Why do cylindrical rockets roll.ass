Dialogue: 1,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家好，我是《每日宇航员》频道的Tim Dodd
Dialogue: 2,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hi, it's me, Tim Dodd, The Everyday Astronaut.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:02.15,0:00:05.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,有一个问题不但我自己问过
Dialogue: 2,0:00:02.15,0:00:05.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here's a fun question that not only have I myself asked
Dialogue: 1,0:00:05.21,0:00:07.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,还有好多人问过我
Dialogue: 2,0:00:05.21,0:00:07.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I actually get asked this quite often.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:07.40,0:00:11.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,为什么我们经常听到“开始滚转”、“滚转程序完成”等播报
Dialogue: 2,0:00:07.40,0:00:11.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why do we hear a call-out like "roger roll" or "roll program complete",
Dialogue: 1,0:00:11.02,0:00:15.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时看到火箭沿X轴旋转？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:11.02,0:00:15.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,at which point we see the rocket rotate or roll on its x-axis?
Dialogue: 1,0:00:15.09,0:00:21.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,开始滚转、滚转检查、滚转执行完毕
Dialogue: 2,0:00:15.09,0:00:21.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,Roll commence, clear. Roll checks out. Roll program has commenced.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:21.39,0:00:23.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得最好的例子就是航天飞机了
Dialogue: 2,0:00:21.39,0:00:23.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,The best example of this, I think was the Space Shuttle
Dialogue: 1,0:00:23.87,0:00:27.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,它有非常明显的大幅度滚转程序
Dialogue: 2,0:00:23.87,0:00:27.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,which had a really obvious and really dramatic roll program.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:27.83,0:00:28.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,当它飞离发射塔时
Dialogue: 2,0:00:27.83,0:00:28.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,As soon as it cleared the tower,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:28.85,0:00:32.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,你能注意到它在进行很明显、甚至有点吓人的滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:00:28.85,0:00:32.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can see it making a very impressive and sometimes, scary-looking roll.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:32.85,0:00:37.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许这样的机动对于航天飞机这样不对称的载具倒还算合理
Dialogue: 2,0:00:32.85,0:00:37.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, a maneuver like this makes sense when a vehicle's asymmetrical like a space shuttle
Dialogue: 1,0:00:37.56,0:00:43.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,但像Saturn V、Titan、Atlas、Delta IV这些柱状的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:00:37.56,0:00:43.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,but why do cylindrical rockets like Saturn V or Titan or Atlas or Delta IV,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:43.53,0:00:45.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,为啥也要进行滚转呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:43.53,0:00:45.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,why do they even bother doing a roll
Dialogue: 1,0:00:45.78,0:00:47.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,为何火箭就不能简单地拐弯
Dialogue: 2,0:00:45.78,0:00:47.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,and can't rockets just tip over
Dialogue: 1,0:00:47.59,0:00:52.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,执行一些俯仰、偏航的操作，直接指向要飞的方向？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:47.59,0:00:52.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and go in whatever direction they need to go, do a little pitch here, a little yaw there,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:52.32,0:00:55.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,只要指向它想飞的方向
Dialogue: 2,0:00:52.32,0:00:55.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,as long as the pointy end is going in the direction it's intended to go,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:55.38,0:01:00.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,谁会管火箭哪面朝地哪面朝天？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:55.38,0:01:00.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,who cares which side of the rocket is facing the earth and which side is facing space? Right?
Dialogue: 1,0:01:01.10,0:01:06.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么今天，我们将首先定义俯仰、偏航、滚转，及其对应在火箭上的方向
Dialogue: 2,0:01:01.10,0:01:06.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,So today, first we'll define the pitch, yaw, roll and their corresponding axes on a rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:06.06,0:01:08.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后我们将开门见山地揭示火箭滚转的原因
Dialogue: 2,0:01:06.06,0:01:08.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we're gonna dive into why a rocket rolls in the first place,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:08.69,0:01:11.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,观察发射方位角与发射轨迹的关系
Dialogue: 2,0:01:08.69,0:01:11.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,take a look at launch azimuths and the relationships to trajectories
Dialogue: 1,0:01:11.86,0:01:14.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们还将了解一些独特的对正方向角的方法
Dialogue: 2,0:01:11.86,0:01:14.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we'll look at some unique solutions to orientations,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:14.29,0:01:18.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,包括一些发射时不进行滚转来对正轨迹的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:01:14.29,0:01:18.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,including some rockets that don't roll on ascent to line with their trajectories at all.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:19.38,0:01:20.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们走起吧
Dialogue: 2,0:01:19.38,0:01:20.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's get started.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:31.77,0:01:33.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是我很喜欢的话题
Dialogue: 2,0:01:31.77,0:01:33.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is one of those topics I love,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.60,0:01:36.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为原因可能会很难猜
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.60,0:01:36.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,where at first, the reason feels kind of perplexing
Dialogue: 1,0:01:36.05,0:01:38.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当你听到一个解释后你就马上拍大腿
Dialogue: 2,0:01:36.05,0:01:38.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you hear one explanation you're like oh,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:38.10,0:01:39.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,“啊有道理哈~”
Dialogue: 2,0:01:38.10,0:01:39.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,I guess that makes sense
Dialogue: 1,0:01:40.00,0:01:44.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后你又听到另一个解释，学习了这些边边角角的知识后回头一看
Dialogue: 2,0:01:40.00,0:01:44.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,but then you think of some other reasons and learn of all these weird little edge cases and come to find out
Dialogue: 1,0:01:44.67,0:01:46.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,发现这里的门道还真不少
Dialogue: 2,0:01:44.67,0:01:46.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's actually a lot to unpack here.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:46.49,0:01:47.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外要澄清一点
Dialogue: 2,0:01:46.49,0:01:47.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,And just to clarify things,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:47.92,0:01:52.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们今天要说的是火箭的滚转程序，不是重力转向
Dialogue: 2,0:01:47.92,0:01:52.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're specifically talking about the roll program of rockets and not their gravity turn.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:52.80,0:01:55.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是两个完全不同的东西
Dialogue: 2,0:01:52.80,0:01:55.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are two totally different things.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.32,0:01:56.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们要说的是这个
Dialogue: 2,0:01:55.32,0:01:56.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're focusing on this,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:58.33,0:01:59.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,不是这个
Dialogue: 2,0:01:58.33,0:01:59.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,not this.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:01.24,0:02:01.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个
Dialogue: 2,0:02:01.24,0:02:01.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,This,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:04.12,0:02:05.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,不是这个
Dialogue: 2,0:02:04.12,0:02:05.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,not this.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:07.36,0:02:12.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么我们首先了解下俯仰、偏航、滚转，及其对应在火箭上的方向
Dialogue: 2,0:02:07.36,0:02:12.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start off with a quick overview of pitch, yaw and roll and how they correspond on a rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:12.31,0:02:14.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家可能听说过俯仰、偏航、滚转这三个词
Dialogue: 2,0:02:12.31,0:02:14.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,You may have heard the terms pitch, yaw and roll,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:14.29,0:02:16.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其是在聊飞机的时候
Dialogue: 2,0:02:14.29,0:02:16.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially when talking about airplanes.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:16.32,0:02:19.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于飞机，俯仰指的是机头拉起或者压低
Dialogue: 2,0:02:16.32,0:02:19.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,On an airplane, pitch is the nose pulling up or diving down.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:19.67,0:02:22.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,偏航是机头向左或向右
Dialogue: 2,0:02:19.67,0:02:22.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yaw's the nose going left or right
Dialogue: 1,0:02:22.18,0:02:27.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,而滚转，你可以想象机头不动、翼尖上下移动
Dialogue: 2,0:02:22.18,0:02:27.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,and roll, you can think of the wingtips going up or down while the nose stays in the same place.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:27.04,0:02:30.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于飞机来说，定义俯仰、偏航、滚转很容易
Dialogue: 2,0:02:27.04,0:02:30.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,With airplanes, it's really easy to define pitch, yaw and roll
Dialogue: 1,0:02:30.34,0:02:33.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为飞机有很明显的外形特征
Dialogue: 2,0:02:30.34,0:02:33.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,because airplanes have really obvious characteristics
Dialogue: 1,0:02:33.08,0:02:37.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如机翼、起落架、驾驶舱、尾翼等
Dialogue: 2,0:02:33.08,0:02:37.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,like wings, landing gear, a cockpit and a vertical stabilizer.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:37.97,0:02:42.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可能就会奇怪，对于柱状的火箭怎么定义这些方向呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:02:37.97,0:02:42.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you might think how do you define these dimensions on a cylindrical rocket?
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.62,0:02:44.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然火箭是非常对称的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.62,0:02:44.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,Although a rocket is pretty symmetrical,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.36,0:02:47.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,定义这些方向仍然是很重要的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:44.36,0:02:47.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's still vital to define these dimensions.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:47.13,0:02:51.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,不然火箭可能想往东飞结果一路向北之类的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:47.13,0:02:51.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, otherwise, your rocket might go north instead of east or something.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:51.01,0:02:54.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们在KSP中拿出一架飞机，去掉机翼和尾翼
Dialogue: 2,0:02:51.01,0:02:54.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's take a jetliner and just remove the wings and tail stabilizer.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.80,0:02:58.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,哇，机舱看起来和火箭一样液~
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.80,0:02:58.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hey, look, the fuselage kind of looks like a rocket, perfect.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:58.95,0:03:02.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,这时我们还是有俯仰、偏航、滚转的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:58.95,0:03:02.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we still have our pitch yaw and roll.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.07,0:03:04.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后把它竖起来
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.07,0:03:04.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,We just stand this baby up on its tail and let it rip.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:04.82,0:03:07.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,当年把驾驶舱放在洲际导弹顶上就是这样的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:04.82,0:03:07.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was literally true when cockpits were put on missiles
Dialogue: 1,0:03:07.61,0:03:12.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,像东方号、水星号、双子号、联盟号都是这意思
Dialogue: 2,0:03:07.61,0:03:12.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is basically, all the Vostok, Mercury, Gemini, Soyuz programs were.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:12.56,0:03:14.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在火箭推上发射架
Dialogue: 2,0:03:12.56,0:03:14.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now with a rocket on the launch pad,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:14.90,0:03:18.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们从驾驶舱看还是有相同的俯仰、偏航、滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:03:14.90,0:03:18.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can look at the cockpit for that same pitch, yaw and roll.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.75,0:03:22.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,坐在驾驶舱，俯仰就是你当前的机头上下移动，即绕Y轴旋转
Dialogue: 2,0:03:18.75,0:03:22.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,When sitting in the cockpit, your pitch or your nose up and down is rotating on the y-axis,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.00,0:03:25.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,偏航就是机头左右移动，即绕Z轴旋转
Dialogue: 2,0:03:23.00,0:03:25.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,yawing, left or right is rotating on the z-axis
Dialogue: 1,0:03:25.69,0:03:28.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,左右滚转就是绕X轴运动
Dialogue: 2,0:03:25.69,0:03:28.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,and rolling left or right is on the x-axis.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:28.71,0:03:33.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,与飞机不同的是，火箭的俯仰、偏航、滚转不是由机翼控制的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:28.71,0:03:33.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,Unlike an airplane, the pitch, yaw and roll of a rocket, generally isn't controlled by wings or fins
Dialogue: 1,0:03:33.83,0:03:36.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是由发动机本身控制的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:33.83,0:03:36.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's actually controlled by the engine itself
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.73,0:03:41.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,通过一个有矢量、有时是辅助推进器来帮助控制滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.73,0:03:41.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,via a gimbal and perhaps some auxiliary thrusters to help control roll.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:41.02,0:03:45.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,而机翼、小翼有时会在大气内用于稳定火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:03:41.02,0:03:45.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, wings and fins are sometimes used for stability in the atmosphere.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:45.05,0:03:46.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭底部只放一台发动机的时候
Dialogue: 2,0:03:45.05,0:03:46.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,A single engine on the bottom of a rocket
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.72,0:03:50.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,只能提供两个方向的控制：俯仰和偏航
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.72,0:03:50.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,can only provide two axes of control; that's pitch and yaw.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:51.04,0:03:54.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为发动机推力方向会通过火箭的重心
Dialogue: 2,0:03:51.04,0:03:54.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is because the engine goes through the center of the rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:54.46,0:03:57.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以它只能提供两个方向的扭矩
Dialogue: 2,0:03:54.46,0:03:57.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because of that, it can only apply torque on two axes.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:57.99,0:04:02.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是为了让绝大多数单发动机火箭拥有滚转控制
Dialogue: 2,0:03:57.99,0:04:02.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in order for most single-engine rockets to have roll control,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:02.02,0:04:06.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们会发现火箭外围会有一些辅助推进器
Dialogue: 2,0:04:02.02,0:04:06.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,you'll normally see auxiliary thrusters stuck on the side or the outer perimeter of the rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.75,0:04:09.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些辅助推进器叫“游机”
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.75,0:04:09.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,These auxiliary thrusters are called vernier thrusters
Dialogue: 1,0:04:09.16,0:04:14.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得游机在原版Atlas SM-65 A火箭上看最明显了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:09.16,0:04:14.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I think they're the most obvious on the original Atlas SM-65 A rocket
Dialogue: 1,0:04:14.00,0:04:17.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,联盟号火箭的底部也有几个游机
Dialogue: 2,0:04:14.00,0:04:17.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,and there's several vernier thrusters on the bottom of the Soyuz Rockets as well
Dialogue: 1,0:04:17.90,0:04:23.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,但有些单发动机火箭更聪明，它们使用燃气发生器的废气控制滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:04:17.90,0:04:23.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,but some single-engine rockets get clever and control their roll via the gas generator exhaust

Dialogue: 1,0:05:01.83,0:05:05.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,首先就是火箭需要在飞行中保持稳定
Dialogue: 2,0:05:01.83,0:05:05.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, to begin, a rocket needs to remain stable throughout the flight
Dialogue: 1,0:05:05.14,0:05:07.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,以免其转的太快把自己转散架
Dialogue: 2,0:05:05.14,0:05:07.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it doesn't spin so fast it tears itself apart.

Dialogue: 2,0:05:08.91,0:05:13.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, sure, that's the most basic reason of why the rocket needs to control its roll
Dialogue: 1,0:05:13.25,0:05:18.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我们还是不知道为何火箭在离开发射架后要刻意进行滚转操作呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:05:13.25,0:05:18.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we still get to the question why do they intentionally roll once they get off the launch pad?

Dialogue: 1,0:05:57.83,0:06:00.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,就需要火箭指向一个特定且非常精确的方向

Dialogue: 1,0:06:00.04,0:06:04.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,就需要火箭指向一个特定且非常精确的方向
Dialogue: 2,0:06:00.04,0:06:04.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,is pointing in a very, very specific and accurate direction.

Dialogue: 2,0:06:04.16,0:06:07.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if you were to launch a rocket right on the equator, straight east,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:07.34,0:06:10.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,不但会完全利用地球自转线速度带来的速度优势

Dialogue: 2,0:06:10.72,0:06:12.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,which gives the rocket a nice little boost
Dialogue: 1,0:06:12.90,0:06:16.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,还会进入一个倾角为零的轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:06:12.90,0:06:16.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you'd also place your vehicle on a zero degree inclination.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:16.96,0:06:19.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像地球赤道上的光环一样
Dialogue: 2,0:06:16.96,0:06:19.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's like a nice little belt around the earth's equator
Dialogue: 1,0:06:19.69,0:06:23.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一个有关倾角的例子是国际空间站
Dialogue: 2,0:06:19.69,0:06:23.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,or another fun example of inclination is the International Space Station

Dialogue: 2,0:06:23.01,0:06:26.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is on a 51.6 degree inclination.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:26.56,0:06:30.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个倾角可以刚好让俄罗斯参与其中
Dialogue: 2,0:06:26.56,0:06:30.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it's on this exact inclination so the Russians can participate
Dialogue: 1,0:06:30.10,0:06:33.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,且发射时不需要把助推器扔到中国境内
Dialogue: 2,0:06:30.10,0:06:33.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they can launch without dropping boosters on China
Dialogue: 1,0:06:33.75,0:06:36.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,更不需要为了对接来个狗腿机动
Dialogue: 2,0:06:33.75,0:06:36.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,or without doing a costly dogleg maneuver.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:36.28,0:06:39.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外作为参考，如果火箭从肯尼迪航天中心向正东发射
Dialogue: 2,0:06:36.28,0:06:39.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,And just as a reference, if you launched straight east, out of Kennedy Space Center,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:39.79,0:06:42.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,会进入一个28.6度倾角的轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:06:39.79,0:06:42.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,you'd be on a 28.6 degree inclination
Dialogue: 1,0:06:42.69,0:06:46.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这正是肯尼迪航天中心的纬度
Dialogue: 2,0:06:42.69,0:06:46.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,which you may notice is the exact latitude of the Space Center.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:46.77,0:06:49.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里就要引入方位角的概念了
Dialogue: 2,0:06:46.77,0:06:49.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here's where we get to what your azimuth is.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:49.62,0:06:53.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,方位角就是你在发射台拿一个指南针
Dialogue: 2,0:06:49.62,0:06:53.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,The azimuth is basically if you're holding a compass on the launch pad,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:53.38,0:06:56.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么如果你想飞向预定轨道，你需要向哪个方向飞？
Dialogue: 2,0:06:53.38,0:06:56.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,which direction do you want the rocket to go to get to your desired orbit?
Dialogue: 1,0:06:56.82,0:07:00.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里我们先停一下，澄清一件事
Dialogue: 2,0:06:56.82,0:07:00.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we should pause here for a second and clear up one thing
Dialogue: 1,0:07:00.09,0:07:02.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这让我有点混淆
Dialogue: 2,0:07:00.09,0:07:02.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,because this definitely confused me a bit.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:02.67,0:07:06.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,要明确方位角和倾角的不同
Dialogue: 2,0:07:02.67,0:07:06.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's be sure and note the difference between the azimuth and the inclination.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:06.61,0:07:10.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,方位角是驾驶舱里导航球的指向
Dialogue: 2,0:07:06.61,0:07:10.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,The azimuth is what's on the nav ball inside a cockpit.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:10.37,0:07:16.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,正北是0度、正东是90度、正南是180度、正西是270度
Dialogue: 2,0:07:10.37,0:07:16.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,North on the nav ball is zero degrees while East is 90, South is 180 degrees and west is 270.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:16.94,0:07:19.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,这和倾角完全没关系
Dialogue: 2,0:07:16.94,0:07:19.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this does not line up with the inclinations.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:19.65,0:07:23.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,零度倾角是赤道正上方向东飞行的轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:07:19.65,0:07:23.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,A zero degree inclination is due east on the equator
Dialogue: 1,0:07:23.67,0:07:26.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,极地轨道是90度倾角的轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:07:23.67,0:07:26.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,while a polar orbit is inclined 90 degrees
Dialogue: 1,0:07:27.10,0:07:30.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外，可发射的最小倾角取决于你的纬度
Dialogue: 2,0:07:27.10,0:07:30.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,but again, minimum inclination depends on your latitude.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:30.64,0:07:36.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以只有当你在赤道时向正东飞行才会进入零度倾角的轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:07:30.64,0:07:36.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,So flying due east will only correspond to a zero degree inclination if you were launching on the equator.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:36.94,0:07:41.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,还要记住，所有顺向轨道，或者说和地球自转方向相同的轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:07:36.94,0:07:41.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,And another side note, all pro-grade orbits or orbits that follow the rotation of the earth
Dialogue: 1,0:07:41.87,0:07:44.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,倾角都在0到90度之间
Dialogue: 2,0:07:41.87,0:07:44.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,are between zero and 90 degrees inclination.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:44.73,0:07:49.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使火箭向南飞过赤道它倾角也是0到90度
Dialogue: 2,0:07:44.73,0:07:49.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the rocket is flying south from the equator, it's still between zero and 90 degrees
Dialogue: 1,0:07:49.50,0:07:55.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为倾角单纯是轨道面和赤道面的夹角
Dialogue: 2,0:07:49.50,0:07:55.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,because inclination is really just a measure in degrees how far off angle the orbit is from the equator.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:56.00,0:07:59.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然了，实际情况远没这么简单
Dialogue: 2,0:07:56.00,0:07:59.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course, it's not quite just as simple as this.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:59.00,0:08:03.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果想进入51.6度倾角的轨道和国际空间站对接
Dialogue: 2,0:07:59.00,0:08:03.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you wanna go to 51.6 degrees and rendezvous with the International Space Station,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:03.94,0:08:07.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际的指向并不是51.6度
Dialogue: 2,0:08:03.94,0:08:07.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,you don't actually point at 51.6 degrees.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:07.13,0:08:09.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,你实际会指向大约45度
Dialogue: 2,0:08:07.13,0:08:09.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,You actually point at about 45 degrees
Dialogue: 1,0:08:09.78,0:08:14.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这些就涉及到一些数学计算来考虑到地球的自转和球面几何了
Dialogue: 2,0:08:09.78,0:08:14.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,but now we're getting into some kind of fun math that takes into account the Earth's rotation
Dialogue: 1,0:08:14.26,0:08:16.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这些就涉及到一些数学计算来考虑到地球的自转和球面三角了
Dialogue: 2,0:08:14.26,0:08:16.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and spherical trigonometry
Dialogue: 1,0:08:16.84,0:08:19.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这对于本期视频来讲就说的太远了
Dialogue: 2,0:08:16.84,0:08:19.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,which might be getting a little too far into the weeds for this video.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:19.44,0:08:25.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在我们知道火箭去不同的目标轨道会往不同方向飞
Dialogue: 2,0:08:19.44,0:08:25.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now that we know that rockets don't all follow the same path to get to space into their destinations,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:25.55,0:08:30.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我们就获得些许火箭刻意滚转原因的线索
Dialogue: 2,0:08:25.55,0:08:30.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're starting to get some of the puzzle pieces as to why they might intentionally roll.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:30.35,0:08:34.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,下一条线索，我们就来看看发射台本身
Dialogue: 2,0:08:30.35,0:08:34.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,For our next clue, we need to look no further than the launch pads themselves
Dialogue: 1,0:08:34.58,0:08:38.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我们刚刚提到了Saturn V和航天飞机
Dialogue: 2,0:08:34.58,0:08:38.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,and since we've mentioned rockets like the space shuttle and the Saturn V,

Dialogue: 2,0:11:04.96,0:11:07.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, by zeroing out one of those numbers,
Dialogue: 1,0:11:07.13,0:11:11.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,万向节就会处于最不可能死锁的状态
Dialogue: 2,0:11:07.13,0:11:11.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're keeping the gimbal as far away from potential gimbal lock as possible.
Dialogue: 1,0:11:11.73,0:11:16.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,而万向节死锁是非常非常糟糕的
Dialogue: 2,0:11:11.73,0:11:16.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a gimbal that locks up can be a very, very bad thing.

Dialogue: 2,0:12:35.75,0:12:39.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,It just makes navigating a lot easier than thinking about northeast and southwest.
Dialogue: 1,0:12:39.93,0:12:43.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以如果火箭和发射台经常是保持固定的位置
Dialogue: 2,0:12:39.93,0:12:43.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the rocket and the launchpad are always in a fixed position which,

Dialogue: 1,0:12:49.32,0:12:54.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么最简单的就是给火箭编程，让它自己滚转来对正方向角
Dialogue: 2,0:12:49.32,0:12:54.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,the easiest thing to do is to program the rocket to do a quick roll to align itself with its azimuth.
Dialogue: 1,0:12:54.86,0:12:59.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,这让导航从三维的方程变成了二维的方程

Dialogue: 2,0:13:02.79,0:13:05.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know it doesn't seem like much but it definitely matters.
Dialogue: 1,0:13:05.82,0:13:10.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然，说火箭是俯仰还是偏航就太较真了
Dialogue: 2,0:13:05.82,0:13:10.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now of course whether the vehicle pitches or yaws is a bit pedantic
Dialogue: 1,0:13:10.05,0:13:13.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟这都是人为规定的东西对吧？
Dialogue: 2,0:13:10.05,0:13:13.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,because doesn't someone just define that.
Dialogue: 1,0:13:13.08,0:13:15.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,那接下来要说的就是两者之间另一个重要的区别
Dialogue: 2,0:13:13.08,0:13:15.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, there's still some other important distinctions.
Dialogue: 1,0:13:15.63,0:13:19.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,还说阿波罗，在发射台上宇航员头朝东
Dialogue: 2,0:13:15.63,0:13:19.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sticking with Apollo, the astronauts heads were pointing due east on the launchpad.
Dialogue: 1,0:13:19.85,0:13:22.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,而那个方向其实是土星五号的“肚子”

Dialogue: 1,0:13:22.31,0:13:23.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,而有趣的是

Dialogue: 2,0:13:23.31,0:13:29.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you actually know the command module in the Saturn V had exactly opposite y and z coordinates.
Dialogue: 1,0:13:29.87,0:13:33.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不太明白具体原因，但的确很有意思
Dialogue: 2,0:13:29.87,0:13:33.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't exactly know why but I think it's kind of interesting.
Dialogue: 1,0:13:33.50,0:13:35.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这也意味着当火箭俯仰机动后
Dialogue: 2,0:13:33.50,0:13:35.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this meant when the rocket pitched over,
Dialogue: 1,0:13:35.19,0:13:38.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,指令长可以透过保护罩上的小窗观察外面

Dialogue: 1,0:15:06.81,0:15:11.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,航天飞机是通过固体火箭助推器的矢量喷嘴来控制其俯仰和滚转的
Dialogue: 2,0:15:06.81,0:15:11.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,The shuttle controlled its pitch and roll via gimbaling nozzles on the solid rocket boosters.

Dialogue: 2,0:15:11.74,0:15:16.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, the main space shuttle engines could gimbal too and gimbal a lot
Dialogue: 1,0:15:16.67,0:15:21.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,但它们主要作用是确保推力方向穿过重心
Dialogue: 2,0:15:16.67,0:15:21.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they primarily gimballed to maintain the center of thrust going through the center of mass.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:21.48,0:15:24.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,通过使用固推来控制俯仰

Dialogue: 2,0:15:24.06,0:15:28.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,the gimbal vectors are in line with each other, relative to the center of mass.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:28.86,0:15:31.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能会让控制更加容易
Dialogue: 2,0:15:28.86,0:15:31.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,This probably makes it easier to control.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:31.42,0:15:35.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也关系到像重型猎鹰、Delta IV重型这样的多芯级火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:15:31.42,0:15:35.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is also relevant to multi core rockets like the Falcon Heavy and the Delta IV Heavy
Dialogue: 1,0:15:35.68,0:15:41.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们也都有滚转程序，让芯级的摆放对准飞行轨迹
Dialogue: 2,0:15:35.68,0:15:41.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,which both have a roll program which again, aligns the cores kind of perpendicular to the flight path.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:41.36,0:15:42.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,这可能不是啥大事
Dialogue: 2,0:15:41.36,0:15:42.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this might not be a huge deal or not
Dialogue: 1,0:15:42.89,0:15:44.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我们考虑一下这类的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:15:42.89,0:15:44.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,but let's just take a look at a vehicle like this
Dialogue: 1,0:15:44.61,0:15:49.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果它们飞行时一排发动机是垂直于地平线摆放的
Dialogue: 2,0:15:44.61,0:15:49.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if it were flying with its engines in a roll perpendicular to the horizon,

Dialogue: 2,0:15:49.18,0:15:50.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,the engines that are on the top and the bottom
Dialogue: 1,0:15:50.74,0:15:53.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,将会相对于中央的发动机来说对火箭产生不同的杠杆作用
Dialogue: 2,0:15:50.74,0:15:53.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,would have a different amount of leverage over the vehicle
Dialogue: 1,0:15:53.07,0:15:55.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,将会相对于中央的发动机来说对火箭产生不同的杠杆作用
Dialogue: 2,0:15:53.07,0:15:55.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,compared to that center engine or center core.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:55.72,0:15:57.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以虽然我不敢肯定
Dialogue: 2,0:15:55.72,0:15:57.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm not entirely sure
Dialogue: 1,0:15:57.16,0:16:02.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为这可能是让多芯级火箭平行于地平线飞行的某个原因
Dialogue: 2,0:15:57.16,0:16:02.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I think this might be another reason why they normally fly pretty parallel to the horizon
Dialogue: 1,0:16:02.12,0:16:05.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这类火箭另一个平行地平线飞行的考虑可能是关于分级
Dialogue: 2,0:16:02.12,0:16:05.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they also fly with these rockets flat to the horizon for stage separation
Dialogue: 1,0:16:05.37,0:16:08.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这样两侧的助推有最小的概率撞上中央的芯级
Dialogue: 2,0:16:05.37,0:16:08.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the boosters have the lowest chances of hitting the center core.

Dialogue: 1,0:16:22.97,0:16:27.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,猎鹰九号和电子号火箭都只进行所需的俯仰、偏航机动
Dialogue: 2,0:16:22.97,0:16:27.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both the Falcon 9 and the Electron just pitch and yaw over however much is necessary
Dialogue: 1,0:16:27.92,0:16:32.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,只为一些气动上的考虑和其他少量因素而进行滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:16:27.92,0:16:32.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,and roll for aerodynamic considerations and a few other variables as well.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:32.27,0:16:37.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在真实的3D空间控制火箭其实比听起来难得多
Dialogue: 2,0:16:32.27,0:16:37.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,But controlling a rocket in a true 3D space like this is actually a lot harder than it sounds.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:37.64,0:16:41.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,耗费了好几届学生的心血才解决了其中线性代数的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:16:37.64,0:16:41.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,It took a generation of grad students to actually solve the linear algebra
Dialogue: 1,0:16:41.47,0:16:44.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭也需要算力足够强的计算机
Dialogue: 2,0:16:41.47,0:16:44.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,and have access to computers powerful enough on the rockets
Dialogue: 1,0:16:44.75,0:16:47.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,才能实时解算这种类型的控制
Dialogue: 2,0:16:44.75,0:16:47.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,to do this math in real time for this type of control.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:47.55,0:16:52.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以如果猎鹰九号和电子号不需要滚转，那它们为何要滚转呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:16:47.55,0:16:52.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the Falcon 9 and the Electron Rockets don't need to roll, why do they?
Dialogue: 1,0:16:52.36,0:16:55.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,呃……答案是为了好玩
Dialogue: 2,0:16:52.36,0:16:55.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, apparently, for fun.

Dialogue: 1,0:17:08.94,0:17:12.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且尽管猎鹰九号可以同时控制俯仰和偏航
Dialogue: 2,0:17:08.94,0:17:12.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,and although the Falcon 9 can navigate along both axes,

Dialogue: 1,0:17:19.33,0:17:22.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,而该次发射的载荷是不对称放置的
Dialogue: 2,0:17:19.33,0:17:22.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,and with this particular launch having an offset payload,
Dialogue: 1,0:17:22.33,0:17:24.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能他们需要火箭以某种特定姿态飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:17:22.33,0:17:24.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,perhaps they needed to fly it in a certain way

Dialogue: 1,0:17:28.73,0:17:32.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就是在一二级分离时必须摆正方向
Dialogue: 2,0:17:28.73,0:17:32.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that it for sure wants to be oriented correctly at stage separation.
Dialogue: 1,0:17:32.66,0:17:37.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样一级火箭上的氮气推进器才能让一级翻转回来
Dialogue: 2,0:17:32.66,0:17:37.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first stage has both of its nitrogen thrusters able to help do that flip maneuver.
Dialogue: 1,0:17:37.35,0:17:43.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为猎鹰九号只有两组冷气推进器，呈180度摆放
Dialogue: 2,0:17:37.35,0:17:43.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Since the Falcon 9 has only two packs of cold gas thrusters that are 180 degrees apart from each other,
Dialogue: 1,0:17:43.15,0:17:45.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味着如果火箭旋转了90度
Dialogue: 2,0:17:43.15,0:17:45.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,this means if the vehicle rotated 90 degrees,
Dialogue: 1,0:17:45.20,0:17:48.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,那两组中就只剩一组推进器能让一级翻转了

Dialogue: 1,0:17:57.99,0:18:01.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,原因是其发动机的燃气发生器尾气带一个小角度
Dialogue: 2,0:17:57.99,0:18:01.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was due to the gas generator exhaust that has a slight angle to it.
Dialogue: 1,0:18:01.96,0:18:06.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,就好像Delta IV火箭用RS-68的燃气发生器滚转一样

Dialogue: 1,0:18:11.19,0:18:14.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭本身的矢量要整整一秒才能抵消这个滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:18:11.19,0:18:14.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,it took a second for the engine gimbals to cancel the roll out.
Dialogue: 1,0:18:14.46,0:18:17.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭滚转的另一个考虑是整流罩分离
Dialogue: 2,0:18:14.46,0:18:17.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,And one more reason why Rockets roll is for the fairing separation.
Dialogue: 1,0:18:17.52,0:18:20.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道让整流罩按Y轴向分离还是Z轴向分离的具体考虑是怎样的
Dialogue: 2,0:18:17.52,0:18:20.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I don't exactly know what considerations go in
Dialogue: 1,0:18:20.52,0:18:24.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道让整流罩按Y轴向分离还是Z轴向分离的具体考虑是怎样的
Dialogue: 2,0:18:20.52,0:18:24.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,to choosing whether the fairing would split on its y-axis or its z axis
Dialogue: 1,0:18:24.85,0:18:28.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我肯定会提，因为这一定是考虑因素
Dialogue: 2,0:18:24.85,0:18:28.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it should be noted that this is definitely taken into consideration.
Dialogue: 1,0:18:28.50,0:18:30.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,从目前我能看到的来说
Dialogue: 2,0:18:28.50,0:18:30.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,For instance, from what I can tell, at least,
Dialogue: 1,0:18:30.57,0:18:34.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,太空叉喜欢沿着Y轴、上下方向分离整流罩
Dialogue: 2,0:18:30.57,0:18:34.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,SpaceX tends to ditch their fairings on its y-axis or up and down 
Dialogue: 1,0:18:34.30,0:18:38.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,而ULA喜欢沿Z轴、左右方向分离整流罩
Dialogue: 2,0:18:34.30,0:18:38.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,while ULA tends to ditch its fairings off to the sides on its z-axis.
Dialogue: 1,0:18:38.76,0:18:41.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,这两家分离方向不同的具体原因何在？
Dialogue: 2,0:18:38.76,0:18:41.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why exactly each launch provider chooses to ditch them in this manner,
Dialogue: 1,0:18:41.77,0:18:44.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道，但至少提一下，挺有意思的
Dialogue: 2,0:18:41.77,0:18:44.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not sure but it's kind of fun to note.
Dialogue: 1,0:18:44.42,0:18:49.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以21世纪的火箭终于有能力取消滚转对正方向角这样的操作
Dialogue: 2,0:18:44.42,0:18:49.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a few 21st century rockets finally took the roll to align to the azimuth program out
Dialogue: 1,0:18:49.31,0:18:54.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,但或许我最喜欢的不进行滚转机动的火箭是苏联的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:18:49.31,0:18:54.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,but perhaps my favorite rockets that didn't roll align were Soviet era rockets.
Dialogue: 1,0:18:54.58,0:18:55.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,还记得我最开始说移动整个火箭和(或)发射架来对正方向角太难了吗？
Dialogue: 2,0:18:54.58,0:18:55.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember near the beginning,
Dialogue: 1,0:18:55.69,0:19:01.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,还记得我最开始说移动整个火箭和(或)发射架来对正方向角太难了吗？when I said it'd be too hard to turn the rocket and/or the launch pad to align with its trajectory,
Dialogue: 1,0:19:01.24,0:19:07.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这正是苏联为他们R-7家族的火箭，比如联盟号，想到的解决办法
Dialogue: 2,0:19:01.24,0:19:07.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,well that's actually exactly what the Soviet Union came up with for their R-7 family of rockets like the Soyuz.
Dialogue: 1,0:19:07.98,0:19:14.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错，联盟号的整个发射架都可以旋转来让火箭对正其发射方向
Dialogue: 2,0:19:07.98,0:19:14.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right, the entire launch pad of the Soyuz actually rotates to align the rocket up with its azimuth.
Dialogue: 1,0:19:14.26,0:19:19.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的弊端是你的发射方位角可能在你的发射窗口内有些许变化
Dialogue: 2,0:19:14.26,0:19:19.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now some downsides to this is your azimuth might change ever so slightly throughout your launch window
Dialogue: 1,0:19:19.80,0:19:22.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,而通过旋转发射架来对正方位角的办法
Dialogue: 2,0:19:19.80,0:19:22.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,so by aligning the launch pad to your azimuth,
Dialogue: 1,0:19:22.78,0:19:25.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,会让你的发射窗口、发射轨迹不那么灵活
Dialogue: 2,0:19:22.78,0:19:25.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,you might lose some flexibility in the launch window and flight path.
Dialogue: 1,0:19:25.84,0:19:29.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是新款联盟号所改进的，因为它有了数字计算机
Dialogue: 2,0:19:25.84,0:19:29.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is something the new Soyuz too can do away with now that it has a digital flight computer
Dialogue: 1,0:19:29.95,0:19:33.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在它能自行修正方位角了
Dialogue: 2,0:19:29.95,0:19:33.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it can now align itself on the correct azimuth.
Dialogue: 1,0:19:33.03,0:19:36.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,但载人任务使用的仍然是联盟-FG火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:19:33.03,0:19:36.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,Although crewed missions still use a Soyuz-FG
Dialogue: 1,0:19:36.34,0:19:38.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以仍然要使用可旋转发射架
Dialogue: 2,0:19:36.34,0:19:38.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,which utilizes that rotating table but lastly,
Dialogue: 1,0:19:38.78,0:19:43.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,但还是有一款非常先进、非常超前于时代的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:19:38.78,0:19:43.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,there was still perhaps the most advanced, most ahead of its time rocket,
Dialogue: 1,0:19:43.38,0:19:46.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就是苏联的N-1超级烟花
Dialogue: 2,0:19:43.38,0:19:46.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Soviet Union's N-1 rocket
Dialogue: 1,0:19:46.17,0:19:52.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,其设计是同时控制俯仰和滚转来发射入轨，虽然最后都变成烟花了
Dialogue: 2,0:19:46.17,0:19:52.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,which was meant to, never did, follow its flight path using both pitch and yaw.
Dialogue: 1,0:19:52.29,0:19:54.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭本身有滚转控制推进器
Dialogue: 2,0:19:52.29,0:19:54.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,It had some roll control thrusters
Dialogue: 1,0:19:54.19,0:19:56.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,在前三次发射中都太小了
Dialogue: 2,0:19:54.19,0:19:56.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,that were undersized for the first three launches
Dialogue: 1,0:19:56.44,0:19:58.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,在第四次发射中升级了
Dialogue: 2,0:19:56.44,0:19:58.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then upgraded for the fourth launch
Dialogue: 1,0:19:58.58,0:20:01.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,但它们全都不是用来对正发射方向角的
Dialogue: 2,0:19:58.58,0:20:01.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they weren't used to align to the azimuth.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:01.15,0:20:03.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们只用来稳定
Dialogue: 2,0:20:01.15,0:20:03.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,They were just used for stability.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:03.51,0:20:06.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,唉，真希望它没有变成烟花啊
Dialogue: 2,0:20:03.51,0:20:06.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,I still really wish the N1 had worked out.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:06.25,0:20:07.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,多牛逼的火箭啊
Dialogue: 2,0:20:06.25,0:20:07.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's such an awesome rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:07.87,0:20:10.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是我们总结一下，火箭滚转有以下几个原因
Dialogue: 2,0:20:07.87,0:20:10.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to summarize, rockets roll for a few reasons
Dialogue: 1,0:20:10.95,0:20:13.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像所有的火箭科学等工程学一样
Dialogue: 2,0:20:10.95,0:20:13.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,and like all rocket science and engineering,
Dialogue: 1,0:20:13.15,0:20:16.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样做肯定有好处，那具体原因呢——
Dialogue: 2,0:20:13.15,0:20:16.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's actually some good reasons but as for why,
Dialogue: 1,0:20:16.64,0:20:21.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,简言之就是用滚转来对正方向角比旋转发射架更简单
Dialogue: 2,0:20:16.64,0:20:21.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,well, it's generally easier to roll to align the vehicle to its azimuth than it is to move the launchpad.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:21.77,0:20:24.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这让制导计算机计算起来更简单
Dialogue: 2,0:20:21.77,0:20:24.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,It makes for easier calculations for the guidance computer.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:24.44,0:20:27.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭会出于气动、结构上的考虑而滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:20:24.44,0:20:27.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rockets roll for aerodynamic and structural considerations.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:27.37,0:20:30.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭为了让宇航员有更好的目视参考而滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:20:27.37,0:20:30.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,They roll for the astronauts' vantage point and visual references.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:30.51,0:20:32.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭为了对正整流罩分离时的姿态而滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:20:30.51,0:20:32.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,They roll for fairing deployment orientation.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:32.76,0:20:35.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭为了对正调姿推进器而滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:20:32.76,0:20:35.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,They roll to align auxiliary or control thrusters
Dialogue: 1,0:20:35.21,0:20:39.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭为了更好的视野从而有更好的通信质量而滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:20:35.21,0:20:39.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they roll for best line-of-sight for communications and down links.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:40.27,0:20:43.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这样的回答大家满意吗？
Dialogue: 2,0:20:40.27,0:20:43.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,So does this help answer that question?

Dialogue: 2,0:20:44.84,0:20:46.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you probably know there's a good reason
Dialogue: 1,0:20:46.68,0:20:49.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,但你就是说不清道不明这每一条原因都是啥
Dialogue: 2,0:20:46.68,0:20:49.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's just kind of hard to find all those good reasons.
