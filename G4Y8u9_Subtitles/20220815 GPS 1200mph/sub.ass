Dialogue: 2,0:00:08.28,0:00:13.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,But all of a sudden, your GPS shuts down, and now you have no idea how to get home.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:13.54,0:00:16.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,听起来像是技术限制?
Dialogue: 2,0:00:13.54,0:00:16.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,At first this sounds like it's probably a technical limit, right?

Dialogue: 1,0:00:23.84,0:00:30.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,其实GPS理论上可以在2000公里每小时 或六万英尺以上运行
Dialogue: 2,0:00:23.84,0:00:30.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's not quite right—your GPS would theoretically work just fine at 1,200 mph or at 60,000 feet.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:30.94,0:00:38.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际原因更加奇怪一点 GPS设备制造商会刻意增加这个几乎达不到的限制
Dialogue: 2,0:00:30.94,0:00:38.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,The actual answer is much weirder—your GPS manufacturer set those seemingly impossible limits on purpose

Dialogue: 2,0:00:38.23,0:00:42.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they wanted to stop you from starting a thermonuclear war… technically.

Dialogue: 2,0:00:42.76,0:00:43.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me explain.

Dialogue: 1,0:00:49.10,0:00:54.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是来自于一个比老天爷管的还要宽的机构 美国国防部
Dialogue: 2,0:00:49.10,0:00:54.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was actually created by the only force more powerful than God: the US Department of Defense.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:54.30,0:00:59.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,在七十年代早期 美国在追踪自家核潜艇方面遇到了一点困难
Dialogue: 2,0:00:54.30,0:00:59.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, in the early 1970s, the US was having a little trouble keeping track of all of its nuclear submarines,

Dialogue: 2,0:00:59.90,0:01:02.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,which, y'know, are not the kind of thing you want to lose track of.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:02.84,0:01:07.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,当时潜艇用的一款称为"Transit"的卫星定位系统
Dialogue: 2,0:01:02.84,0:01:07.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the time, these submarines were being tracked with a satellite navigation system called "Transit",
Dialogue: 1,0:01:07.40,0:01:09.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,运行起来和GPS很像
Dialogue: 2,0:01:07.40,0:01:09.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,which worked a whole lot like GPS—
Dialogue: 1,0:01:09.34,0:01:11.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,和两个以上的卫星测量距离来大致给潜艇定位
Dialogue: 2,0:01:09.34,0:01:11.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,a submarine could calculate its approximate location on Earth

Dialogue: 2,0:01:11.77,0:01:14.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,by measuring its distance from two or more Transit satellites.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:14.83,0:01:19.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这个系统缺点在于 天上没那么多卫星
Dialogue: 2,0:01:14.83,0:01:19.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this system had a bit of a problem: there just weren't enough satellites to go around.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:19.49,0:01:24.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这套系统有五颗卫星服务全球
Dialogue: 2,0:01:19.49,0:01:24.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,At any given time, the system would use five satellites to cover the entire Earth,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:24.12,0:01:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以绝大多数时间 潜艇可能只能看到其中一个卫星
Dialogue: 2,0:01:24.12,0:01:28.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that meant that most of the time, a submarine would only have line-of-sight to one of them.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:28.22,0:01:33.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,只用一颗卫星理论上还是可以确定大致位置的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:28.22,0:01:33.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was still technically possible to calculate a rough location with the measurements from one satellite,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.18,0:01:36.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这涉及到一大堆复杂的物理和数学的东西
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.18,0:01:36.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that involved a whole bunch of convoluted physics and math stuff
Dialogue: 1,0:01:36.06,0:01:37.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就不解释了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:36.06,0:01:37.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,that I don't really have time to explain,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:37.35,0:01:41.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我只放一秒钟维基百科的截图
Dialogue: 2,0:01:37.35,0:01:41.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I'm just gonna put up a screenshot of a Wikipedia article here for exactly one second
Dialogue: 1,0:01:41.02,0:01:43.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,好奇的同学可以暂停看一看
Dialogue: 2,0:01:41.02,0:01:43.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you can go ahead and pause the video if you're into that kinda stuff.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:43.68,0:01:47.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,嫌太长不爱看的朋友们 直说结果的话
Dialogue: 2,0:01:43.68,0:01:47.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now for all the people who didn't pause the video because they're cool and hate science,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:47.56,0:01:51.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这套系统技术上能用 但不完全能用
Dialogue: 2,0:01:47.56,0:01:51.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,the main takeaway was that this system technically worked but… not very well.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.44,0:01:54.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,美军需要为他们的潜艇搞一套更可靠的系统
Dialogue: 2,0:01:51.44,0:01:54.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,The US military needed something more reliable for their submarines,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.54,0:01:58.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是就有了我们今天的全球卫星定位系统 GPS
Dialogue: 2,0:01:54.54,0:01:58.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they rolled out the system we use today: Navstar GPS.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:58.15,0:02:00.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,卫星数量更多 设备更精确
Dialogue: 2,0:01:58.15,0:02:00.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,There were more satellites, with more accurate equipment,

Dialogue: 1,0:02:09.08,0:02:13.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,可虽然国防部为GPS系统豪掷数十亿美元
Dialogue: 2,0:02:09.08,0:02:13.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,But here's the thing: when the Department of Defense spent billions of dollars developing GPS,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.55,0:02:18.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,但它并不是为全球老百姓服务 提升大家生活质量的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.55,0:02:18.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,it wasn't meant to be a public worldwide utility that made everyone's lives easier and more convenient.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:18.07,0:02:21.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,事实上 当时宪法中有一整条规定禁止这样做
Dialogue: 2,0:02:18.07,0:02:21.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, there's a whole section in the constitution prohibiting that.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:21.14,0:02:24.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,系统首年投入使用的时候 是完全保密的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:21.14,0:02:24.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the first year that the system was in use, it was completely classified—
Dialogue: 1,0:02:24.51,0:02:28.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,别说让老百姓用了 老百姓甚至不知道它的存在
Dialogue: 2,0:02:24.51,0:02:28.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,not only did the public not have access to it, they didn't even know it existed.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:28.84,0:02:32.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,原因在于 至少在当时 "知道什么东西在哪里" 是一种很危险的高科技
Dialogue: 2,0:02:28.84,0:02:32.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's because, at least at the time, the big technological advancement of

Dialogue: 2,0:02:46.28,0:02:48.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the US was not eager to give it up.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:48.80,0:02:51.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,但快进到1983年9月
Dialogue: 2,0:02:48.80,0:02:51.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,But, fast forward to September of 1983—

Dialogue: 2,0:02:58.37,0:03:01.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,got shot down, and everyone on board was killed.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:01.87,0:03:05.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然 如果美国政府将GPS开放给平民与私人飞机 这起事故就完全可以避免
Dialogue: 2,0:03:01.87,0:03:05.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, it was pretty obvious that this incident could have been avoided entirely
Dialogue: 1,0:03:05.60,0:03:09.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然 如果美国政府将GPS开放给平民与私人飞机 这起事故就完全可以避免
Dialogue: 2,0:03:05.60,0:03:09.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the US government had made GPS accessible to civilians and private airlines.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.97,0:03:13.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,当时的总统罗纳德·里根 肯定内心有点矛盾
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.97,0:03:13.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,The president at the time, Ronald Reagan, was probably a little conflicted—

Dialogue: 2,0:03:13.70,0:03:16.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,on one hand, killing innocent people was his favorite pastime,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.52,0:03:19.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,但另一方面 他还得应付之后的选举
Dialogue: 2,0:03:16.52,0:03:19.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,but on the other hand, he was almost up for reelection.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.22,0:03:21.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,在1983年开放GPS的使用不会像它刚推出时那样成为一个大的国家安全问题

Dialogue: 1,0:03:21.23,0:03:25.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,在1983年开放GPS的使用不会像它刚推出时那样成为一个大的国家安全问题
Dialogue: 2,0:03:21.23,0:03:25.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,wouldn't be as big of a national security issue as it was when it was first rolled out;
Dialogue: 1,0:03:25.08,0:03:29.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,苏联已经在前一年推出了他们自己的GPS系统 格洛纳斯
Dialogue: 2,0:03:25.08,0:03:29.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Soviet Union had already launched their own GPS system, ГЛОНАСС, the year before,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:29.47,0:03:32.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 他们用不用美版GPS已经不重要了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:29.47,0:03:32.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it didn't really matter if they got their hands on Navstar.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:32.14,0:03:36.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是 大韩航空空难两周后 里根开放了平民对于GPS的使用
Dialogue: 2,0:03:32.14,0:03:36.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, two weeks after the Korean Air incident, Reagan opened GPS to the public,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.66,0:03:39.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这也有一些安全方面的注意事项
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.66,0:03:39.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,but this came with a couple of security caveats.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:39.96,0:03:42.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,首先 信号是被加扰的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:39.96,0:03:42.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first was that the signal would be partially scrambled,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:42.30,0:03:46.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以精确度只有一百米

Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.03,0:03:53.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,信号加扰在克林顿时期 2000年解除
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.03,0:03:53.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,This restriction was later overturned by Bill Clinton in 2000,

Dialogue: 2,0:03:55.25,0:03:59.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, the other main caveat was put in place by the Department of Commerce, and it was this.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:59.86,0:04:04.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,简言之 所有便携GPS接收机(即可以销售出口美国的)
Dialogue: 2,0:03:59.86,0:04:04.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically, any GPS receiver that was exportable—meaning that it could be sold outside the US—
Dialogue: 1,0:04:04.68,0:04:07.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,需要加入高度与速度限制 防止设备安装于弹道导弹上
