Dialogue: 0,0:25:17.93,0:25:21.60,中,,0,0,0,,we've already touched on them earlier and, and almost every video I've made,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:21.73,0:25:26.46,中,,0,0,0,,but being able to spontaneously combust is one of their biggest advantages.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:26.46,0:25:31.55,中,,0,0,0,,And the fact that they don't need any additional considerations to keep liquid at cryogenic temperature,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:31.55,0:25:33.50,中,,0,0,0,,is just really a pure bonus.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:33.50,0:25:34.46,中,,0,0,0,,I mean, don't get me wrong,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:34.46,0:25:39.54,中,,0,0,0,,they're a total pain in the butt in other ways like being super toxic and carcinogenic,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:39.54,0:25:42.94,中,,0,0,0,,but in the case of ignition and sheer reliability,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:43.31,0:25:44.72,中,,0,0,0,,they're hard to beat.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:44.72,0:25:48.94,中,,0,0,0,,Which is why they're so common for maneuvering thrusters and on orbit engines
Dialogue: 0,0:25:48.94,0:25:53.90,中,,0,0,0,,where reliability and long duration missions matter, since they won't boil off.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:53.90,0:25:55.80,中,,0,0,0,,But for LOx based propellants,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:55.80,0:26:01.85,中,,0,0,0,,if you put your fuel and oxidizer in contact with each other, it likely won't lead to combustion.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:02.03,0:26:06.36,中,,0,0,0,,If you took liquid methane and you poured it into a container of liquid oxygen,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:06.86,0:26:09.08,中,,0,0,0,,don't really expect anything to happen.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:09.08,0:26:12.54,中,,0,0,0,,Even if you swirled it around without a source of ignition,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:12.71,0:26:15.92,中,,0,0,0,,the two will coexist surprisingly peacefully.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:15.92,0:26:19.21,中,,0,0,0,,Even in gaseous form, this is true for the most part,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:19.21,0:26:25.10,中,,0,0,0,,but as a gas, it's much more likely to ignite with just a small ignition source.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:25.10,0:26:31.14,中,,0,0,0,,So non-hypergolic fuels and oxidizers not only need to be properly mixed for stable combustion,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:31.30,0:26:36.06,中,,0,0,0,,they also need an ignition source to initiate the combustion process in the first place.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:36.06,0:26:38.07,中,,0,0,0,,But once stable combustion has been achieved,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:38.07,0:26:41.87,中,,0,0,0,,and assuming there's adequate and stable flow of your propellants,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:42.05,0:26:47.22,中,,0,0,0,,the initial ignition process is no longer necessary, and it can actually be self-sustaining.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:47.22,0:26:50.78,中,,0,0,0,,The combustion in the chamber acts as a continual source of ignition.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:50.78,0:26:53.43,中,,0,0,0,,Okay, so we've actually got to light up our propellants.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:53.58,0:26:57.26,中,,0,0,0,,Perhaps the simplest option outside of hypergolic propellants
Dialogue: 0,0:26:57.26,0:27:03.65,中,,0,0,0,,is what the Soviet Union decided to do with the R7 and what Russia still uses today on the Soyuz,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:03.90,0:27:07.53,中,,0,0,0,,which is basically just some giant matchsticks.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:07.53,0:27:14.90,中,,0,0,0,,Yep, literally just some large braces with a pair of pyrotechnics that are put inside each combustion chamber
Dialogue: 0,0:27:14.90,0:27:18.54,中,,0,0,0,,and are all lit prior to the propellants arriving in the combustion chamber.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:18.54,0:27:23.70,中,,0,0,0,,Now, this is also possible because the gas generator on the RD-107 and RD-108
Dialogue: 0,0:27:23.80,0:27:28.46,中,,0,0,0,,is basically just a monoprop thruster, so it doesn't need a separate source of ignition.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:28.46,0:27:31.55,中,,0,0,0,,So you could, the main thing you really have to worry about on those engines
Dialogue: 0,0:27:31.55,0:27:33.78,中,,0,0,0,,is actually igniting the main combustion chamber.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:33.78,0:27:39.30,中,,0,0,0,,But it's not very elegant and it's probably not a great option once you're in space either.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:39.30,0:27:46.05,中,,0,0,0,,So for that, we'll have to look into some other options that are capable of space starts and potentially restarts.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:46.05,0:27:49.85,中,,0,0,0,,Perhaps one of the most common methods is to basically use a spark plug.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:49.85,0:27:54.22,中,,0,0,0,,Okay, maybe not your off the shelf spark plug from a Ford Fiesta,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:54.46,0:27:56.14,中,,0,0,0,,but the concept is the same,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:56.22,0:27:59.58,中,,0,0,0,,take a high electrical voltage and have it jump a gap,
Dialogue: 0,0:27:59.70,0:28:05.09,中,,0,0,0,,which provides the perfect opportunity to ignite the propellant with ionized electrical energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:05.09,0:28:06.57,中,,0,0,0,,As you can probably imagine,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:06.57,0:28:12.32,中,,0,0,0,,it does require a good amount of electrical energy to power a rocket engine size spark plug.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:12.68,0:28:16.62,中,,0,0,0,,So rockets using this approach may need to carry heavy batteries,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:16.62,0:28:21.42,中,,0,0,0,,or utilize ground support equipment to run current through the igniter at startup.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:21.42,0:28:24.65,中,,0,0,0,,Another method is similar to a spark igniter,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:24.65,0:28:29.01,中,,0,0,0,,actually, it's again similar to the automobile industry with diesel engines,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:29.19,0:28:31.06,中,,0,0,0,,and that's using a glow plug.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:31.30,0:28:35.05,中,,0,0,0,,Glow plugs also require a lot of electricity to convert to heat,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:35.22,0:28:39.87,中,,0,0,0,,similar to an incandescent light bulb, an electrical heater coil, or a toaster.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:39.87,0:28:43.05,中,,0,0,0,,There needs to be enough heat energy on the surface of the glow plug,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:43.05,0:28:45.30,中,,0,0,0,,to initiate combustion of the propellants.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:45.30,0:28:50.52,中,,0,0,0,,And again, once stable combustion has been achieved, the glow plug can just be turned off.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:50.52,0:28:52.47,中,,0,0,0,,Another method is to use a laser.
Dialogue: 0,0:28:52.68,0:28:58.02,中,,0,0,0,,Lasers can very precisely focus the beam of energy and tune it to excite the propellant molecules,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:58.22,0:29:03.29,中,,0,0,0,,so it has the potential to be more efficient than other electrically driven devices.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:03.29,0:29:04.73,中,,0,0,0,,Now, it's not very common yet,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:04.73,0:29:08.82,中,,0,0,0,,although Airbus does have some variance of optical ignition for some of their boosters.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:08.82,0:29:11.53,中,,0,0,0,,These methods are all great and commonplace,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:11.53,0:29:14.94,中,,0,0,0,,but they all require massive amounts of electrical power,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:15.08,0:29:19.08,中,,0,0,0,,which is likely stored in big and not so energy dense batteries.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:19.27,0:29:24.45,中,,0,0,0,,So what if you actually could just use a chemical reaction to start the ignition process?
Dialogue: 0,0:29:24.45,0:29:27.92,中,,0,0,0,,This is actually pretty common and extremely effective.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:27.92,0:29:31.38,中,,0,0,0,,In fact, if you've ever seen a Falcon 9 or Heavy launch,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:31.50,0:29:35.81,中,,0,0,0,,you may have noticed a green flash right at the beginning of ignition.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:36.42,0:29:40.38,中,,0,0,0,,That, my friends, is the injection of a pyrophoric ignition fluid
Dialogue: 0,0:29:40.38,0:29:43.78,中,,0,0,0,,coming in contact with oxygen to begin stable combustion.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:43.78,0:29:45.96,中,,0,0,0,,Pyroforks are a type of hypergolic.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:46.12,0:29:51.87,中,,0,0,0,,It's a fluid that will spontaneously and virtually instantaneously react with oxygen.
Dialogue: 0,0:29:52.01,0:29:57.83,中,,0,0,0,,So just inject some pyrophoric fluids into the combustion chamber along with oxygen,
Dialogue: 0,0:29:57.83,0:30:00.92,中,,0,0,0,,and ta-da, you've got yourself a flame.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:00.92,0:30:06.21,中,,0,0,0,,SpaceX uses an ignition fluid called TEA-TEB or triethyl aluminum triethyl borine.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:06.46,0:30:12.80,中,,0,0,0,,It's stored in their own canisters onboard the rocket and allows for multiple restarts of their Merlin engines.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:12.80,0:30:16.24,中,,0,0,0,,Now, not every engine is connected to a TEA-TEB canister,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:16.34,0:30:18.55,中,,0,0,0,,only the engines that would do a relight,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:18.55,0:30:24.35,中,,0,0,0,,so 3 of the 9 Merlin engines on the booster and the vacuum Merlin engine on the upper stage.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:24.35,0:30:28.98,中,,0,0,0,,But on the ground, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are lit using ground supplied TEA-TEB,
Dialogue: 0,0:30:28.98,0:30:33.06,中,,0,0,0,,because why not keep those systems and their weight on the ground
Dialogue: 0,0:30:33.06,0:30:35.96,中,,0,0,0,,if you don't need to carry that mass off the launch pad?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:35.96,0:30:40.90,中,,0,0,0,,Now, SpaceX has taken a little bit of a hybrid approach to ignition with their new Raptor engine.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:41.11,0:30:43.92,中,,0,0,0,,The Raptor engine uses what are called a torch igniters.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:44.06,0:30:49.13,中,,0,0,0,,Torch igniters are basically just a fancy version of the lighters that you might use to light a candle.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:49.30,0:30:54.46,中,,0,0,0,,You may or may not hear them called ASIs or Augmented Spark Igniters.
Dialogue: 0,0:30:54.46,0:30:57.13,中,,0,0,0,,The ASI has its own little small spark ignition
Dialogue: 0,0:30:57.13,0:31:00.76,中,,0,0,0,,and then its own supply of methylox that allows for the torch to burn.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:00.76,0:31:06.56,中,,0,0,0,,So it in itself is almost like a little flame thrower that's initially lit with a spark ignition.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:06.86,0:31:10.51,中,,0,0,0,,Then that torch remains lit through the rest of the startup sequence.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:10.51,0:31:14.30,中,,0,0,0,,So it's kind of like the cascading effect of the solid rocket booster ignition,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:14.30,0:31:19.40,中,,0,0,0,,this uses a smaller electrical ignition source to ignite a small baby flame thrower.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:19.40,0:31:22.99,中,,0,0,0,,But surprisingly, this is only done on the preburners,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:22.99,0:31:28.03,中,,0,0,0,,because believe it or not, the Raptor engine has no igniters in the main combustion chamber.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:28.03,0:31:30.16,中,,0,0,0,,So you got torch igniters for the main chamber,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:31.80,0:31:34.78,中,,0,0,0,,but Raptor 2 has no torch igniters in the main chamber.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:34.78,0:31:37.05,中,,0,0,0,,So you can see it's much cleaner around the chamber area.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:37.74,0:31:39.51,中,,0,0,0,,How do you... how does it light then?
Dialogue: 0,0:31:41.23,0:31:43.09,中,,0,0,0,,Well, that's secret sauce!
Dialogue: 0,0:31:43.92,0:31:49.30,中,,0,0,0,,Although Elon was tight-lipped about how exactly they get away with ignition in the main combustion chamber,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:49.70,0:31:54.02,中,,0,0,0,,it's actually assumed that SpaceX is getting away with homogenous combustion,
Dialogue: 0,0:31:54.02,0:31:59.28,中,,0,0,0,,or basically spontaneous combustion when the methane and oxygen come in contact with each other.
Dialogue: 0,0:31:59.28,0:32:04.39,中,,0,0,0,,But the main reason that they can get away with that is because in the Raptors full flow stage combustion cycle,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:04.39,0:32:09.20,中,,0,0,0,,both the fuel and the oxidizer are preburned in their own preburners,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:09.35,0:32:13.36,中,,0,0,0,,and then they arrive in the main combustion chamber as hot gases already.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:13.36,0:32:16.00,中,,0,0,0,,So take the fact that it's a gas-gas interaction
Dialogue: 0,0:32:16.00,0:32:20.04,中,,0,0,0,,along with ridiculously high pressures seen in the combustion chamber,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:20.04,0:32:22.48,中,,0,0,0,,no ignition source is necessary,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:22.48,0:32:26.85,中,,0,0,0,,the propellant is already plenty hot and bothered and ready to burn.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:26.85,0:32:31.36,中,,0,0,0,,Well, I think that pretty much covers all the major parts of starting a rocket engine,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:31.36,0:32:33.70,中,,0,0,0,,but before we get into some examples,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:33.86,0:32:36.58,中,,0,0,0,,let's actually cover one more challenge:
Dialogue: 0,0:32:36.58,0:32:39.18,中,,0,0,0,,starting a rocket engine in space.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:44.14,0:32:46.88,中,,0,0,0,,Starting a rocket engine on the ground is pretty challenging,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:46.88,0:32:49.39,中,,0,0,0,,but at least it has a few things going its way.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:49.39,0:32:53.63,中,,0,0,0,,First off, the rocket can utilize a lot of ground support equipment for startup.
Dialogue: 0,0:32:54.01,0:32:59.05,中,,0,0,0,,This means the rocket doesn't need to provide crazy amounts of high pressure starting propellant,
Dialogue: 0,0:32:59.05,0:33:03.22,中,,0,0,0,,electricity, ignition fluid, or whatever else you may need.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:03.22,0:33:08.27,中,,0,0,0,,And best of all, gravity is pulling down on the rocket and the propellant held inside.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:08.41,0:33:12.53,中,,0,0,0,,So the more dense liquid propellant will sit at the bottom of the tanks,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:12.53,0:33:17.84,中,,0,0,0,,while only at the very top of the tank, opposite of the feed tubes will have gases.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:17.84,0:33:21.94,中,,0,0,0,,But the same thing isn't true when trying to light an engine in space.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:22.17,0:33:24.05,中,,0,0,0,,Well, not just specifically in space,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:24.18,0:33:27.85,中,,0,0,0,,but more when you are not accelerating or not on the ground.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:27.85,0:33:29.66,中,,0,0,0,,Because when not accelerating,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:29.66,0:33:32.36,中,,0,0,0,,everything is in the same inertial reference frame.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:32.36,0:33:37.19,中,,0,0,0,,In other words, when the engines are off and the spacecraft is just floating in space,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:37.19,0:33:39.03,中,,0,0,0,,there is no acceleration,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:39.03,0:33:43.39,中,,0,0,0,,meaning the propellant is more or less just a blob floating around in a tank.
Dialogue: 0,0:33:43.53,0:33:46.58,中,,0,0,0,,So in order to start a rocket engine in space,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:46.58,0:33:50.90,中,,0,0,0,,we first need to make sure the liquid propellant is at the bottom of the tank,
Dialogue: 0,0:33:50.90,0:33:56.74,中,,0,0,0,,so the pumps engine and or the thrusters can suck up the liquid as intended
Dialogue: 0,0:33:56.74,0:34:00.04,中,,0,0,0,,and not get gas bubbles, which can be really bad.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:00.04,0:34:04.36,中,,0,0,0,,A common method for doing this is by using what's known as ullage thrusters.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:04.52,0:34:08.84,中,,0,0,0,,This is where you either use a small solid rocket motor or cold gas thruster
Dialogue: 0,0:34:08.84,0:34:10.47,中,,0,0,0,,to settle the propellants.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:10.47,0:34:14.38,中,,0,0,0,,You can almost think of it like a butterfly net trying to catch butterflies.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:14.38,0:34:16.25,中,,0,0,0,,By moving through space,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:16.25,0:34:19.64,中,,0,0,0,,it'll basically catch and collect all of the liquid propellant.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:19.64,0:34:23.80,中,,0,0,0,,You'll see footage of ullage thrusters at stage separation for many rockets.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:23.94,0:34:29.43,中,,0,0,0,,This incredibly iconic imagery of the S-IVB ignition is actually from a Saturn IB,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:29.43,0:34:33.58,中,,0,0,0,,but it's the same stage that was used on the upper stage of the Saturn V.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:33.86,0:34:37.22,中,,0,0,0,,Not only did the ullage motors help separate the stages,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:37.22,0:34:39.40,中,,0,0,0,,but it also did the propellant settling.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:39.55,0:34:43.38,中,,0,0,0,,This may also need to be done for any restart in space.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:43.38,0:34:47.30,中,,0,0,0,,Say you have a circularization burn or a geostationary transfer burn,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:47.30,0:34:52.28,中,,0,0,0,,or a direct to geostationary orbital insertion burn, or whatever you might have.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:52.64,0:34:57.35,中,,0,0,0,,If it's a liquid fueled rocket engine, you'll likely have to do an ullage burn.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.42,0:35:00.63,中,,0,0,0,,And similar to a rocket needing to do a spin start again.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:00.75,0:35:02.66,中,,0,0,0,,If you need to do multiple burns,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:02.87,0:35:07.81,中,,0,0,0,,you might need to either have multiple solid rocket cartridges or use a cold gas thruster
Dialogue: 0,0:35:07.81,0:35:09.80,中,,0,0,0,,so you can fire it up whenever you need to.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:09.80,0:35:12.21,中,,0,0,0,,Cold gas is pretty common for ullage thrusters
Dialogue: 0,0:35:12.21,0:35:15.83,中,,0,0,0,,since it might also be used as maneuvering propellant for stages.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:16.15,0:35:19.66,中,,0,0,0,,Even the Falcon 9 booster has to use cold gas thrusters
Dialogue: 0,0:35:19.66,0:35:22.61,中,,0,0,0,,to settle the propellant before boost back and entry burns.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:22.61,0:35:28.84,中,,0,0,0,,You can use a cold gas thruster in space because it uses gaseous propellant stored at high pressure,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:28.84,0:35:33.86,中,,0,0,0,,so there is equal pressure throughout the entire tank, the gases won't blob about.

Dialogue: 0,0:39:46.39,0:39:50.21,中,,0,0,0,,But as a quick review, the RS-25 has two preburners.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:50.21,0:39:54.78,中,,0,0,0,,Since it's fuel rich closed cycle, both preburners are fuel rich,

Dialogue: 0,0:39:58.17,0:40:02.51,中,,0,0,0,,one preburner powers the oxygen pumps and the other powers the fuel pumps.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:02.51,0:40:06.40,中,,0,0,0,,Then there's a small boost pump on the oxygen side that feeds the preburners,

Dialogue: 0,0:40:09.72,0:40:12.04,中,,0,0,0,,and there's a handful of valves.

Dialogue: 0,0:40:15.30,0:40:20.68,中,,0,0,0,,Then there's the main fuel valve, which feeds the preburners and the regen cooling channels.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:20.82,0:40:24.67,中,,0,0,0,,But the regen system has a separate valve called the chamber coolant valve,

Dialogue: 0,0:40:29.69,0:40:34.04,中,,0,0,0,,Then there's three oxygen valves, one that feeds each of the three combustion chambers,

Dialogue: 0,0:40:37.76,0:40:41.65,中,,0,0,0,,There's a few recirculation pipes that feed boiling off gaseous propellant

Dialogue: 0,0:40:56.94,0:41:00.40,中,,0,0,0,,and will be the first items to receive each propellant in the system.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:00.40,0:41:05.68,中,,0,0,0,,Now there's obviously a million other small tubes and pipes and sensors littering the real engine,
Dialogue: 0,0:41:05.68,0:41:09.48,中,,0,0,0,,but to try to keep this understandable, I think we'll just leave it at this for now.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:09.48,0:41:13.01,中,,0,0,0,,As we know, the first thing a cryogenic liquid propellant engine needs to do

Dialogue: 0,0:41:30.48,0:41:33.02,中,,0,0,0,,So they would open the main fuel prevalve
Dialogue: 0,0:41:33.02,0:41:37.92,中,,0,0,0,,that allows liquid hydrogen to flow through the fuel pumps down to the main fuel valve.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:38.17,0:41:41.66,中,,0,0,0,,There's a small recirculation flow that either dumps some of the hydrogen
Dialogue: 0,0:41:41.66,0:41:44.51,中,,0,0,0,,or might even pump some of it back into the fuel inlet.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:44.60,0:41:48.78,中,,0,0,0,,Liquid oxygen fills the oxygen side of the engine by opening the oxygen prevalve

Dialogue: 0,0:53:25.95,0:53:30.84,中,,0,0,0,,it's in a steady state, and there shouldn't really be any real surprises.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:30.84,0:53:35.90,中,,0,0,0,,But what happens when an engine throttles down for maximum aerodynamic pressure or MaxQ,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:35.90,0:53:39.42,中,,0,0,0,,maintaining desired peak G loads or even when it's landing?
Dialogue: 0,0:53:39.42,0:53:43.26,中,,0,0,0,,As you can likely imagine, this varies very much from engine to engine,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:43.26,0:53:46.72,中,,0,0,0,,and frankly, this is probably a topic for another video.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:46.72,0:53:52.14,中,,0,0,0,,But in short, engines generally throttle by reducing the flow to the preburner or the gas generator,

Dialogue: 0,0:53:57.80,0:53:59.64,中,,0,0,0,,to maintain a fuel rich state.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:59.64,0:54:02.03,中,,0,0,0,,The same thing goes for shutting an engine down.

Dialogue: 0,0:54:03.70,0:54:08.43,中,,0,0,0,,and the general rule of thumb is you never want to get close to stoichiometric conditions.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:08.43,0:54:10.97,中,,0,0,0,,Since engines usually run fuel rich,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:11.06,0:54:15.30,中,,0,0,0,,you do this by first reducing the oxygen flow and then the fuel flow.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:15.30,0:54:18.84,中,,0,0,0,,Generally, you want to shut an engine down pretty much as quickly as possible,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:18.84,0:54:23.73,中,,0,0,0,,but you often have limits on how quickly you can do that to avoid high G loads.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:23.95,0:54:26.76,中,,0,0,0,,For example, when the RS-25 was on the Space Shuttle,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:26.76,0:54:29.87,中,,0,0,0,,there was a limit to how quickly the thrust could decay,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:29.87,0:54:32.61,中,,0,0,0,,so as not to exceed the orbiter's structural limit.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:32.61,0:54:36.13,中,,0,0,0,,The initial oxygen preburner oxygen valve motion
Dialogue: 0,0:54:36.13,0:54:38.88,中,,0,0,0,,was limited to 45% per second.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:39.02,0:54:42.60,中,,0,0,0,,The main oxygen valve also had to be closed at a particular rate,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:42.78,0:54:46.38,中,,0,0,0,,but mostly to ensure there was sufficient back pressure on the turbines,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:46.38,0:54:49.67,中,,0,0,0,,so they wouldn't accidentally over speed during the shutdown process.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:49.67,0:54:55.28,中,,0,0,0,,To me, it's just crazy how many considerations there are to absolutely every single input and condition.

Dialogue: 0,0:54:58.25,0:55:03.25,中,,0,0,0,,frankly can really only be learned the hard way by examining scraps of an engine
Dialogue: 0,0:55:03.25,0:55:05.08,中,,0,0,0,,and trying to figure out what went wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:05.08,0:55:10.22,中,,0,0,0,,I think it's kind of this mindset that drives SpaceX to test their Raptor engines so quickly.

Dialogue: 0,0:55:17.18,0:55:18.62,中,,0,0,0,,they can learn more quickly.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:18.74,0:55:20.94,中,,0,0,0,,There's countless lessons that they have learned,
Dialogue: 0,0:55:20.94,0:55:24.81,中,,0,0,0,,that have shaped safe operation during startup throttling and shut down.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:24.81,0:55:29.01,中,,0,0,0,,And I know that many of you are probably wanting to know how exactly the Raptor engine starts.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:29.10,0:55:34.66,中,,0,0,0,,Its startup process isn't as well publicly documented, of course, as say the RS-25,
Dialogue: 0,0:55:34.66,0:55:36.64,中,,0,0,0,,but it does have some similarities.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:36.64,0:55:39.62,中,,0,0,0,,It of course, has two preburners, like the RS-25,
Dialogue: 0,0:55:39.62,0:55:44.52,中,,0,0,0,,but the biggest difference is that one preburner is fuel rich and the other is oxidizer rich.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:44.52,0:55:49.10,中,,0,0,0,,So this means the interaction between the two preburners is even more intertwined.
