Dialogue: 1,0:32:49.39,0:32:53.63,中,,0,0,0,,首先 火箭发动机可以使用地面支持设备来辅助启动
Dialogue: 2,0:32:49.39,0:32:53.63,英,,0,0,0,,First off, the rocket can utilize a lot of ground support equipment for startup.
Dialogue: 1,0:32:54.01,0:32:59.05,中,,0,0,0,,这意味着火箭不需要自带大量用于起转的高压物质
Dialogue: 2,0:32:54.01,0:32:59.05,英,,0,0,0,,This means the rocket doesn't need to provide crazy amounts of high pressure starting propellant,

Dialogue: 1,0:33:03.22,0:33:08.27,中,,0,0,0,,而最大的优势是重力可以让燃料在火箭箱体中沉底
Dialogue: 2,0:33:03.22,0:33:08.27,英,,0,0,0,,And best of all, gravity is pulling down on the rocket and the propellant held inside.
Dialogue: 1,0:33:08.41,0:33:12.53,中,,0,0,0,,因此 密度更大的液体燃料会稳稳沉在箱底
Dialogue: 2,0:33:08.41,0:33:12.53,英,,0,0,0,,So the more dense liquid propellant will sit at the bottom of the tanks,

Dialogue: 2,0:33:37.19,0:33:39.03,英,,0,0,0,,there is no acceleration,
Dialogue: 1,0:33:39.03,0:33:43.39,中,,0,0,0,,推进剂会变成漂浮在箱体内的液球
Dialogue: 2,0:33:39.03,0:33:43.39,英,,0,0,0,,meaning the propellant is more or less just a blob floating around in a tank.
Dialogue: 1,0:33:43.53,0:33:46.58,中,,0,0,0,,因此 为了在太空中启动发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:33:43.53,0:33:46.58,英,,0,0,0,,So in order to start a rocket engine in space,
Dialogue: 1,0:33:46.58,0:33:50.90,中,,0,0,0,,我们首先要保证液体推进剂在箱中沉底
Dialogue: 2,0:33:46.58,0:33:50.90,英,,0,0,0,,we first need to make sure the liquid propellant is at the bottom of the tank,
