Dialogue: 2,0:03:12.46,0:03:17.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why exactly this time last year i knew for this video i needed to fly down to check out the rover
Dialogue: 1,0:03:17.71,0:03:20.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,还要赶在它被运到佛罗里达发射之前
Dialogue: 2,0:03:17.71,0:03:20.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,right before it got shipped off to florida to be launched
Dialogue: 1,0:03:20.39,0:03:24.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在我看火星车之前 我先去看了看Ben 他是我以前的老板
Dialogue: 2,0:03:20.39,0:03:24.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,but before i checked out the rover i first stopped in to see Ben who was my old boss

Dialogue: 1,0:03:47.36,0:03:52.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,这满墙零件的画面很好的说明了为什么在JPL工作太帅了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:47.36,0:03:52.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,and a hardware wall like this is just a great illustration of what makes JPL such a cool place to work
Dialogue: 1,0:03:52.36,0:03:57.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,啊这个是我设计的 我和Andy在GRAIL项目上做的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:52.36,0:03:57.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually I designed this, this is my hardware from GRAIL with Andy
Dialogue: 1,0:03:57.08,0:04:00.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个还挺巧妙的 这些弯曲的部分是为了应对温度的变化
Dialogue: 2,0:03:57.08,0:04:00.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,this was cool because you got these like flexures for like temperature variation
Dialogue: 1,0:04:00.77,0:04:04.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,不是为了好看 而是真的为了想办法实现某些功能
Dialogue: 2,0:04:00.77,0:04:04.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this isn't just for show this is like literally when you're trying to figure out a way to do things

Dialogue: 2,0:04:04.76,0:04:06.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are examples of how it's been done before, right?
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.98,0:04:09.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,对 而且这里有很多是反面教材
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.98,0:04:09.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,right and a lot of these are made by examples of this is the way you shouldn't do
Dialogue: 1,0:04:09.81,0:04:12.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,-靠 所以我设计的零件…  -所以你的零件摆在这里了 懂了吧
Dialogue: 2,0:04:09.81,0:04:12.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,-oh so that's why my hardware  -that's why your hardware's up there, right?
Dialogue: 1,0:04:12.72,0:04:16.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后我们去看了火星车 见到了我的朋友Emily
Dialogue: 2,0:04:12.72,0:04:16.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,after that we headed down to check out the rover and meet up with my friend Emily
Dialogue: 1,0:04:16.15,0:04:18.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在看火星车之前我们必须全副武装
Dialogue: 2,0:04:16.15,0:04:18.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,but before we could just go in and see it we had to get suited up
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.72,0:04:21.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为火星车是要去寻找生命迹象的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.72,0:04:21.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the rover is looking for signs of biological life
Dialogue: 1,0:04:21.64,0:04:25.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,可不能还没到火星呢就把样品污染了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:21.64,0:04:25.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we don't want to contaminate our samples before we even arrive
Dialogue: 1,0:04:25.21,0:04:27.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以穿衣服然后吹风就要花上一阵
Dialogue: 2,0:04:25.21,0:04:27.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,so a bunny suit and air shower can go a long way
Dialogue: 1,0:04:27.96,0:04:31.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,Emily是探测器下降级和巡航级的组装主管
Dialogue: 2,0:04:27.96,0:04:31.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,Emily by the way was the vehicle assembly lead for the descent and cruise stages
Dialogue: 1,0:04:31.96,0:04:33.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,责任非常重
Dialogue: 2,0:04:31.96,0:04:33.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a big responsibility

Dialogue: 2,0:04:33.47,0:04:38.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,-this is the rover  -the flight rover, it will be on Mars 12 months from now
Dialogue: 1,0:04:38.20,0:04:42.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,离近了看感觉它好复杂啊
Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.20,0:04:42.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's so complex when you come up and get this close
Dialogue: 1,0:04:42.22,0:04:46.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上毅力号是迄今为止人类送到其他星球上的最复杂的物体了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:42.22,0:04:46.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,in fact Perseverance is the most complex thing humans have ever built and sent to another planet

Dialogue: 2,0:04:53.09,0:04:55.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,and while it might look pretty similar to the past rover Curiosity
Dialogue: 1,0:04:55.95,0:05:00.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,但两者的科学仪器是完全不同的 因为科学目标有所改变
Dialogue: 2,0:04:55.95,0:05:00.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the science instruments are completely different because the science objectives have changed
Dialogue: 1,0:05:00.07,0:05:05.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,这次最大的不同是钻头不再是单纯打碎石头然后在火星车上研究
Dialogue: 2,0:05:00.07,0:05:05.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,the most notable difference is this time the drill isn't there just to create rock dust to study on the rover
Dialogue: 1,0:05:05.26,0:05:09.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,毅力号有一个中空的钻头 可以抽取一段粉笔大小的岩石样本
Dialogue: 2,0:05:05.26,0:05:09.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,Perseverance has a hollow drill bit to core out a chunk of rock the size of a piece of chalk
Dialogue: 1,0:05:09.86,0:05:13.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,还能打包起来留下43个不同的样品
Dialogue: 2,0:05:09.86,0:05:13.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then package it up and leave behind 43 separate samples
Dialogue: 1,0:05:13.83,0:05:17.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,用于未来任务收集起来并送回地球
Dialogue: 2,0:05:13.83,0:05:17.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,for a future mission to collect and send back to Earth
Dialogue: 1,0:05:17.12,0:05:20.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样 我们就能用地球上的先进设备研究样本上生命曾经存在的证据了
Dialogue: 2,0:05:17.12,0:05:20.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,that way we could study the samples for those past signs of life
Dialogue: 1,0:05:20.08,0:05:24.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这样的检测设备火星车根本放不下
Dialogue: 2,0:05:20.08,0:05:24.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,using the most state-of-the-art instruments on earth that we could never fit on a rover
Dialogue: 1,0:05:24.44,0:05:27.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 为了获取那段粉笔大小的岩石样品
Dialogue: 2,0:05:24.44,0:05:27.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,so then to capture that chalk size rock sample
Dialogue: 1,0:05:27.23,0:05:31.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,这次毅力号不但在外侧有机械臂 在内部也有一个
Dialogue: 2,0:05:27.23,0:05:31.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,not only is there an arm on the outside but this time there's one on the inside too
Dialogue: 1,0:05:31.75,0:05:37.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,它是一个小型机械手 可以操控样品管
Dialogue: 2,0:05:31.75,0:05:37.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,it is a miniature robot arm inside the body of the rover that manipulates the sample tube

Dialogue: 2,0:05:37.34,0:05:39.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,-and there's one right here  -wow
Dialogue: 1,0:05:39.26,0:05:41.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,-这就是要留在火星上的?  -没错
Dialogue: 2,0:05:39.26,0:05:41.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,-and so is this what you leave behind?  -exactly
Dialogue: 1,0:05:41.87,0:05:45.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,-我能说这有点像火星车在拉臭臭吗?  -没错!  -好
Dialogue: 2,0:05:41.87,0:05:45.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,-is it fair to say this is like the poop of the rover?  -exactly  -okay
Dialogue: 1,0:05:45.99,0:05:48.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,-你觉得这比喻咋样?我看他们之前好像不太喜欢  -好啊
Dialogue: 2,0:05:45.99,0:05:48.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,-do you like that analogy? because they didn't like it earlier  -yeah
Dialogue: 1,0:05:50.15,0:05:54.62,辉中,,0,600,0,,我们的确会说火星车要在火星表面把样品“拉”出去
Dialogue: 2,0:05:50.15,0:05:54.62,辉英,,0,600,0,,we do like to say that the rover's gonna poop out the sample on the surface
Dialogue: 1,0:05:53.58,0:05:55.55,辉中,,1300,0,0,,你看 这比喻很不错啊
Dialogue: 2,0:05:53.58,0:05:55.55,辉英,,1300,0,0,,see that's a good analogy
Dialogue: 1,0:05:55.55,0:05:59.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 毅力号是实打实的火星表面采样返回任务的第一步
Dialogue: 2,0:05:55.55,0:05:59.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,so Perseverance is really only the first leg of returning a piece of Mars to earth
Dialogue: 1,0:05:59.88,0:06:03.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,未来几次任务用我的话说就是 拉臭臭-捡臭臭-射！
Dialogue: 2,0:05:59.88,0:06:03.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,future missions will complete what i like to call the poop scoop and shoot maneuver
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.53,0:06:05.69,辉中 - 复制 (3),,0,0,8,,{\fs40}也就是之前提到的“拉臭臭-捡臭臭-射”流程
Dialogue: 1,0:06:03.53,0:06:07.84,辉中,,0,0,145,,这是我的朋友Liz 她负责样品采集系统的所有测试工作
Dialogue: 2,0:06:03.53,0:06:07.84,辉英,,0,0,110,,this is my friend Liz by the way and she's in charge of all the testing for the sample retrieval system
Dialogue: 1,0:06:07.84,0:06:11.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们做的事情前无古人 所以必须要进行测试
Dialogue: 2,0:06:07.84,0:06:11.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're doing things that nobody else does so we have to test it
Dialogue: 1,0:06:11.32,0:06:14.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,她在一个密封舱内进行了各种不同构型的测试
Dialogue: 2,0:06:11.32,0:06:14.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,so she tests all sorts of different configurations in a chamber
Dialogue: 1,0:06:14.36,0:06:18.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,舱内可以模拟极端温度和压力 保证设备在火星上能正常工作
Dialogue: 2,0:06:14.36,0:06:18.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,that recreates the extreme temperatures and pressures to make sure it will function on Mars
Dialogue: 1,0:06:18.95,0:06:22.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为一旦发射到太空就变成泼出去的水了 你不可能上去维修它
Dialogue: 2,0:06:18.95,0:06:22.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,because once you send something to space it's gone and you can't exactly fix it
Dialogue: 1,0:06:22.93,0:06:27.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以必须要进行测试 这也是为什么测试在JPL是非常重要的事情
Dialogue: 2,0:06:22.93,0:06:27.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it just has to work which is why testing is such a big deal here at JPL
Dialogue: 1,0:06:27.17,0:06:29.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,我的朋友Matt提到了另一种测试方法
Dialogue: 2,0:06:27.17,0:06:29.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,my buddy Matt here mentioned another way this is done
Dialogue: 1,0:06:29.60,0:06:33.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们会造两艘航天器 一个去火星 一个留在地球进行测试
Dialogue: 2,0:06:29.60,0:06:33.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we build two spacecraft one that goes to Mars and one that we keep here on earth to test
Dialogue: 1,0:06:33.28,0:06:37.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是好奇号的复制品 它的双胞胎现在就在火星上跑
Dialogue: 2,0:06:33.28,0:06:37.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is an exact replica of curiosity who's driving around on Mars right now
Dialogue: 1,0:06:37.29,0:06:40.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们用手边这辆测试行驶避障 翻越碎石的能力
Dialogue: 2,0:06:37.29,0:06:40.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we use this one to test driving around obstacles and driving over rocks
Dialogue: 1,0:06:41.00,0:06:43.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他的确很懂翻越碎石这些事
Dialogue: 2,0:06:41.00,0:06:43.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he knows a thing or two about driving over rocks
Dialogue: 1,0:06:43.34,0:06:47.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他同时是机遇号和好奇号的“司机”
Dialogue: 2,0:06:43.34,0:06:47.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,because he was a rover driver for both opportunity and curiosity
Dialogue: 1,0:06:47.67,0:06:53.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,这人算是这个星球上驾驶另一个星球上的车的 可能仅有的40人吧
Dialogue: 2,0:06:47.67,0:06:53.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,this guy is like one of maybe 40 people in the world who has driven a vehicle on another planet
Dialogue: 1,0:06:53.34,0:06:55.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的老牛逼了
Dialogue: 2,0:06:53.34,0:06:55.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is kind of a big deal
Dialogue: 1,0:06:55.24,0:06:59.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,毅力号另一个亮点是它底部还有一个折叠无人直升机 机智号
Dialogue: 2,0:06:55.24,0:06:59.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so a few more cool things about Perseverance are that it has a mini helicopter drone
Dialogue: 1,0:06:59.01,0:07:01.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,毅力号另一个亮点是它底部还有一个折叠无人直升机 机智号
Dialogue: 2,0:06:59.01,0:07:01.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,stowed away on its underbelly named ingenuity
Dialogue: 1,0:07:01.38,0:07:04.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这将是人类首次在其他星球上的有动力飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:07:01.38,0:07:04.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,this will be mankind's first powered flight on another planet
Dialogue: 1,0:07:04.47,0:07:06.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,有点像当年的莱特兄弟
Dialogue: 2,0:07:04.47,0:07:06.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,which sort of makes this a Wright Brother's moment
Dialogue: 1,0:07:06.66,0:07:09.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,火星车和无人机会互相拍一些好看的照片
Dialogue: 2,0:07:06.66,0:07:09.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,the rover and the drone will get great footage of each other
Dialogue: 1,0:07:09.14,0:07:13.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然我们主要目的是用来测试 未来我们可以用它来探测地形
Dialogue: 2,0:07:09.14,0:07:13.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we're mainly testing it out so that in the future we might use drones to scout out terrain for us
Dialogue: 1,0:07:13.88,0:07:16.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者去难以到达的地方采集样品
Dialogue: 2,0:07:13.88,0:07:16.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,or get samples from hard to reach locations
Dialogue: 1,0:07:16.34,0:07:20.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者用无人机集群为人类从一个地方到另一个地方运货
Dialogue: 2,0:07:16.34,0:07:20.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you could have swarms of drones carrying materials for humans from one site to another
Dialogue: 1,0:07:20.75,0:07:26.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,毅力号还有一个叫MOXIE的设备 基本上相当于一个机械树
Dialogue: 2,0:07:20.75,0:07:26.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Perseverance is also testing out a new instrument called MOXIE that basically amounts to a mechanical tree
Dialogue: 1,0:07:26.05,0:07:29.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,功能是将二氧化碳转换成氧气
Dialogue: 2,0:07:26.05,0:07:29.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,because its function is to convert co2 into oxygen
Dialogue: 1,0:07:29.67,0:07:32.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,未来可用于人类的呼吸 作为火箭的燃料
Dialogue: 2,0:07:29.67,0:07:32.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,which future explorers will need to breathe and for rocket fuel
Dialogue: 1,0:07:32.87,0:07:35.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,火星车在这间无尘室内已经呆了一年半了

Dialogue: 1,0:08:33.03,0:08:38.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为从到达火星大气顶部到着陆火星 一共只有7分钟
Dialogue: 2,0:08:33.03,0:08:38.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we've literally got seven minutes to get from the top of the atmosphere to the surface of Mars
Dialogue: 1,0:08:38.03,0:08:43.13,辉注,,0,0,0,,每小时13000英里≈每小时21000公里

Dialogue: 1,0:08:43.13,0:08:47.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,航天器完全要靠自己完成 没有任何地球的帮助
Dialogue: 2,0:08:43.13,0:08:47.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the spacecraft has to do it all on its own with no help from us on earth
Dialogue: 1,0:08:47.13,0:08:48.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,当它进入上层大气
Dialogue: 2,0:08:47.13,0:08:48.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,when it first hits the upper atmosphere
Dialogue: 1,0:08:48.61,0:08:52.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,剧烈的摩擦会让防热大底发光发热 就像太阳表面一样
Dialogue: 2,0:08:48.61,0:08:52.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,the friction causes the heat shield to start glowing like the surface of the sun
Dialogue: 1,0:08:52.19,0:08:57.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,与此同时推进器还会进行调整从而瞄准预定着陆点
Dialogue: 2,0:08:52.19,0:08:57.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the while thrusters are firing to steer and adjust its course towards the target location
Dialogue: 1,0:08:57.32,0:09:00.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的气动减速可以消耗99%的能量
Dialogue: 2,0:08:57.32,0:09:00.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that aero-breaking gets rid of 99 of the energy
Dialogue: 1,0:09:00.40,0:09:03.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后为了那剩余的1% 我们会打开超音速降落伞
Dialogue: 2,0:09:00.40,0:09:03.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,so for the last one percent we deploy a supersonic parachute
Dialogue: 1,0:09:03.47,0:09:07.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后像打开镜头盖一样抛掉防热大底
Dialogue: 2,0:09:03.47,0:09:07.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we've got to pop off the heat shield we no longer need like removing a lens cap
Dialogue: 1,0:09:07.00,0:09:08.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样雷达就能看清地面了
Dialogue: 2,0:09:07.00,0:09:08.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the radar can start viewing the ground
Dialogue: 1,0:09:08.88,0:09:13.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,但即使有了降落伞 速度还是高达每小时200英里 对于着陆来说太快了
Dialogue: 1,0:09:08.88,0:09:13.86,辉注,,0,0,0,,每小时200英里≈每小时320公里
Dialogue: 2,0:09:08.88,0:09:13.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,but even with the parachute it's still traveling 200 miles per hour which is way too fast to land
Dialogue: 1,0:09:13.86,0:09:17.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们之后要抛掉后盖 点燃火箭发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:09:13.86,0:09:17.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so that's where we cut loose of the back shell and fire the rockets
Dialogue: 1,0:09:17.08,0:09:18.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这样的造型还是不能着陆
Dialogue: 2,0:09:17.08,0:09:18.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we can't quite land in this configuration
Dialogue: 1,0:09:18.99,0:09:22.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为火箭尾焰会吹起太多碎片 损伤火星车
Dialogue: 2,0:09:18.99,0:09:22.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the rockets will kick up too much debris and damage the rover
Dialogue: 1,0:09:22.20,0:09:26.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们要用一条21英尺长的绳子缓缓把火星车降到火星表面
Dialogue: 1,0:09:22.20,0:09:26.15,辉注,,0,0,0,,21英尺≈6.4米
Dialogue: 2,0:09:22.20,0:09:26.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,so then we lower it from a 21-foot rope and gently land the rover on the surface
Dialogue: 1,0:09:26.15,0:09:30.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,随后我的天空起重机将用其最后的燃料飞得越远越好 最终壮烈坠毁

Dialogue: 2,0:09:30.07,0:09:33.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,as far away from the rover as its remaining fuel will carry it
Dialogue: 1,0:09:33.08,0:09:36.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,短短七分钟 航天器就牺牲了外表所有零件
Dialogue: 2,0:09:33.08,0:09:36.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so in just seven minutes the spacecraft has completely metamorphosized

Dialogue: 2,0:09:36.79,0:09:39.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,shedding all its sacrificial elements
Dialogue: 1,0:09:39.08,0:09:43.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,只剩一辆火星车 静静地安全地停在火星表面
Dialogue: 2,0:09:39.08,0:09:43.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,until you're left with just a rover sitting alone safely on the surface of Mars
Dialogue: 1,0:09:43.88,0:09:46.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 你看到的一切画面都是CG动画
Dialogue: 2,0:09:43.88,0:09:46.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,now everything you just saw was a CGI animation
Dialogue: 1,0:09:46.34,0:09:48.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但着陆后几天 准备好吃惊吧
Dialogue: 2,0:09:46.34,0:09:48.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,but a few days after landing we'll all be blown away

Dialogue: 1,0:09:53.65,0:09:55.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们会看到降落伞展开
Dialogue: 2,0:09:53.65,0:09:55.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,we'll see the parachute inflate
Dialogue: 1,0:09:55.20,0:09:58.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,听到火星车着陆时铝制车轮和火星表面接触的声音
Dialogue: 2,0:09:55.20,0:09:58.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,and hear the crunch of the aluminum wheels as they touch down

Dialogue: 2,0:09:58.44,0:10:00.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and make contact with the martian surface
Dialogue: 1,0:10:00.49,0:10:02.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,而因为火星离我们太远了
Dialogue: 2,0:10:00.49,0:10:02.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,and because Mars is so far away
Dialogue: 1,0:10:02.29,0:10:07.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,火星车到地球光速单程就要12分钟
Dialogue: 2,0:10:02.29,0:10:07.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,to get a signal from the vehicle to our planet it takes about 12 minutes at the speed of light
Dialogue: 1,0:10:07.19,0:10:11.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味着 当航天器发出到达火星大气上层的信号
Dialogue: 2,0:10:07.19,0:10:11.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that means after the spacecraft sends a signal that has reached the top of the atmosphere
Dialogue: 1,0:10:11.59,0:10:15.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后信号传回地球 告诉我们恐怖七分钟已经开始了

Dialogue: 2,0:10:15.48,0:10:21.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,for at least five minutes the vehicle has actually already been on the surface either alive or dead
Dialogue: 1,0:10:22.11,0:10:23.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以它必须是全自动的
Dialogue: 2,0:10:22.11,0:10:23.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why it has to be autonomous
Dialogue: 1,0:10:23.88,0:10:27.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,它需要在各个时间点自行决策到底往哪飞
Dialogue: 2,0:10:23.88,0:10:27.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means it makes all its own choices on the exact timing of things and where to steer
Dialogue: 1,0:10:27.94,0:10:29.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,没有任何来自地球的控制
Dialogue: 2,0:10:27.94,0:10:29.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,without anyone from earth controlling it
