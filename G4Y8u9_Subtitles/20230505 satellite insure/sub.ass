Dialogue: 2,0:01:41.82,0:01:46.44,英,,0,0,0,,Now, selling life insurance isn't all that complicated, because people are pretty predictable,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:46.44,0:01:49.63,中,,0,0,0,,特别是手里有上百万人的平均情况时
Dialogue: 2,0:01:46.44,0:01:49.63,英,,0,0,0,,especially when you're taking the average of thousands or millions of them.

Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.83,0:01:56.99,中,,0,0,0,,因为人命的赔付额并不高
Dialogue: 2,0:01:54.83,0:01:56.99,英,,0,0,0,,because people just aren't worth very much.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:56.99,0:01:59.38,中,,0,0,0,,但这一切到了卫星就全变了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:56.99,0:01:59.38,英,,0,0,0,,None of these things are true when it comes to satellites,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:59.38,0:02:02.41,中,,0,0,0,,这也是为什么给卫星投保是个高风险的活
Dialogue: 2,0:01:59.38,0:02:02.41,英,,0,0,0,,and that's why insuring them is such a risky task—
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.41,0:02:06.37,中,,0,0,205,,实际上 有好几年赔付额远远超过了保费
Dialogue: 2,0:02:02.41,0:02:06.37,英,,0,0,170,,in fact, there have been plenty of years where insurers lost way more than they made
Dialogue: 1,0:02:06.37,0:02:09.53,中,,0,0,205,,因为这些计算真的太难进行了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:06.37,0:02:09.53,英,,0,0,170,,because these calculations are just so difficult to pull off.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:09.53,0:02:13.32,中,,0,0,205,,不过如果想知道他们如何尽力不赔钱的 那么可以接着往下看
Dialogue: 2,0:02:09.53,0:02:13.32,英,,0,0,170,,But if you were wondering how they at least attempt to not lose money, here's how it works.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.32,0:02:17.17,中,,0,0,0,,一颗卫星的生命周期全程都会涉及各种保险
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.32,0:02:17.17,英,,0,0,0,,Each stage of the satellite's life is covered by a different kind of insurance policy,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:17.17,0:02:20.58,中,,0,0,0,,每一款都是针对卫星在该阶段可能面临的特定风险
Dialogue: 2,0:02:17.17,0:02:20.58,英,,0,0,0,,each geared to the particular risks that the satellite might face during that period.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:20.58,0:02:22.51,中,,0,0,0,,首先是"发射前保险"
Dialogue: 2,0:02:20.58,0:02:22.51,英,,0,0,0,,The first is pre-launch insurance,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:22.51,0:02:25.92,中,,0,0,0,,覆盖了从卫星离开制造设施起 到点火后几秒钟的时间
Dialogue: 2,0:02:22.51,0:02:25.92,英,,0,0,0,,which covers the satellite between the time that it leaves the manufacturing facility,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:25.92,0:02:28.58,中,,0,0,0,,覆盖了从卫星离开制造设施起 到点火后几秒钟的时间
Dialogue: 2,0:02:25.92,0:02:28.58,英,,0,0,0,,all the way up until a few seconds after ignition;
Dialogue: 1,0:02:28.58,0:02:31.77,中,,0,0,0,,这与任何其他需要安全运到佛罗里达的昂贵物体的保险没什么不同
Dialogue: 2,0:02:28.58,0:02:31.77,英,,0,0,0,,this isn't all that different from insuring any other hugely expensive object
Dialogue: 1,0:02:31.77,0:02:34.54,中,,0,0,0,,这与任何其他需要安全运到佛罗里达的昂贵物体的保险没什么不同
Dialogue: 2,0:02:31.77,0:02:34.54,英,,0,0,0,,that needs to be transported to Florida without being destroyed beyond repair,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:34.54,0:02:38.32,中,,0,0,0,,所以我们来看接下来有意思的地方: 发射保险
Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.54,0:02:38.32,英,,0,0,0,,so let's move on to where things get interesting: launch insurance.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:38.32,0:02:42.95,中,,0,0,0,,发射保险保障卫星的生效期非常短暂 但非常关键
Dialogue: 2,0:02:38.32,0:02:42.95,英,,0,0,0,,Launch insurance covers the satellite for a very brief, but very crucial period of time,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.95,0:02:45.75,中,,0,0,0,,从发射无法终止时开始生效
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.95,0:02:45.75,英,,0,0,0,,kicking in as soon as the launch can no longer be aborted,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:45.75,0:02:50.16,中,,0,0,0,,到卫星在太空成功与火箭分离时为止
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.75,0:02:50.16,英,,0,0,0,,up until the point that the satellite has successfully detached from the launch vehicle in space.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.16,0:02:54.33,中,,0,0,0,,这种风险类型的计算几乎是不可能做到准确的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:50.16,0:02:54.33,英,,0,0,0,,Calculating the risks for this type of coverage is almost impossible to do accurately—
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.33,0:02:57.25,中,,0,0,0,,大部分取决于运载火箭自身的可靠性
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.33,0:02:57.25,英,,0,0,0,,most of this hinges on the reliability of the launch vehicle itself,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:57.25,0:03:02.18,中,,0,0,0,,还会有烦人的《国际武器贸易条例》(ITAR)搅局
Dialogue: 2,0:02:57.25,0:03:02.18,英,,0,0,0,,but uh oh, here come the International Traffic in Arms Regulations to ruin everyone's fun again:
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.18,0:03:04.90,中,,0,0,0,,实际上 用来将卫星送上太空的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.18,0:03:04.90,英,,0,0,0,,it turns out that the rockets we use to send satellites to space
Dialogue: 1,0:03:04.90,0:03:09.01,中,,0,0,0,,与用来将致命武器送到阿富汗的婚礼上的火箭非常相似
Dialogue: 2,0:03:04.90,0:03:09.01,英,,0,0,0,,are awfully similar to the rockets we use to send deadly explosives to Afghani weddings,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.01,0:03:11.65,中,,0,0,0,,所以这些数据大部分都是保密的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.01,0:03:11.65,英,,0,0,0,,so most of this data is kept secret;
Dialogue: 1,0:03:11.65,0:03:15.61,中,,0,0,0,,很少有保险公司能够获得特定运载火箭的具体信息
Dialogue: 2,0:03:11.65,0:03:15.61,英,,0,0,0,,very few insurers are ever given access to the specifics of a given launch vehicle,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:15.61,0:03:19.01,中,,0,0,0,,即使有 通常也要与美国签署一份同意法令
Dialogue: 2,0:03:15.61,0:03:19.01,英,,0,0,0,,and when they are, they usually have to sign a consent decree with the United States
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.01,0:03:22.85,中,,0,0,0,,允许他们在签合同后的几年里在该公司的办公地点派驻政府监督员
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.01,0:03:22.85,英,,0,0,0,,allowing them to station government overseers around the clock in the company's offices
Dialogue: 1,0:03:22.85,0:03:24.53,中,,0,0,0,,允许他们在签合同后的几年里在该公司的办公地点派驻政府监督员
Dialogue: 2,0:03:22.85,0:03:24.53,英,,0,0,0,,for years after the fact.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:24.53,0:03:28.22,中,,0,0,0,,保险公司往往只能搜集公共领域中的有限信息
Dialogue: 2,0:03:24.53,0:03:28.22,英,,0,0,0,,Insurers are often left with whatever limited information is in the public domain,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:28.22,0:03:32.82,中,,0,0,0,,而这些信息很难为数十亿美元的保险合同背书
Dialogue: 2,0:03:28.22,0:03:32.82,英,,0,0,0,,and that information usually isn't the best basis for a multi-billion-dollar insurance contract.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:32.82,0:03:36.23,中,,0,0,0,,比如举个例子 核保员可能网上一查 发现
Dialogue: 2,0:03:32.82,0:03:36.23,英,,0,0,0,,Just as an example, they might be dealing with statistics like this:
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.23,0:03:39.69,中,,0,0,0,,这款火箭当前发射成功率是零
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.23,0:03:39.69,英,,0,0,0,,a rocket that technically has a 100% failure rate.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:39.69,0:03:43.98,中,,0,0,0,,但又不能真给一个百分百失败的火箭签保单
Dialogue: 2,0:03:39.69,0:03:43.98,英,,0,0,0,,Since they can't actually issue an insurance policy with a 100% chance of failure,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:43.98,0:03:45.95,中,,0,0,0,,所以就只能盲猜一个
Dialogue: 2,0:03:43.98,0:03:45.95,英,,0,0,0,,they just have to take a stab in the dark.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:45.95,0:03:48.82,中,,0,0,0,,而且这一切还是建立在核保人知晓卫星要由哪款火箭发射的情况下
Dialogue: 2,0:03:45.95,0:03:48.82,英,,0,0,0,,And that's assuming that they know what the launch vehicle even is—
Dialogue: 1,0:03:48.82,0:03:52.22,中,,0,0,0,,有时 卫星投保的时候发射的火箭还没选好
Dialogue: 2,0:03:48.82,0:03:52.22,英,,0,0,0,,sometimes, these contracts are written before a launch vehicle has been chosen,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:52.22,0:03:55.65,中,,0,0,0,,那么核保人只能盲猜这颗卫星会由哪枚火箭来打
Dialogue: 2,0:03:52.22,0:03:55.65,英,,0,0,0,,so the underwriters literally just try to guess what rocket might get used
Dialogue: 1,0:03:55.65,0:03:59.38,中,,0,0,0,,然后祈祷千万别是那款百分百失败的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:03:55.65,0:03:59.38,英,,0,0,0,,and cross their fingers that it's not one of the ones with a 100% failure rate.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:59.38,0:04:05.01,中,,0,0,0,,星箭分离后 卫星开始独立运行 新的保险就来了: 在轨保险
Dialogue: 2,0:03:59.38,0:04:05.01,英,,0,0,0,,Now, once the satellite is on its own, a new kind of insurance kicks in: in-orbit insurance.
