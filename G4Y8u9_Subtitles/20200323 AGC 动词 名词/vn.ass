Dialogue: 1,0:01:03.15,0:01:07.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,但因为AGC没有我们平常熟悉的操控界面
Dialogue: 2,0:01:03.15,0:01:07.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,But because the guidance computer didn't have those interfaces that we're used to
Dialogue: 1,0:01:07.04,0:01:09.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如全键盘和文字编辑器之类的东西
Dialogue: 2,0:01:07.04,0:01:09.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,like keyboards and word processors and all those things,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:09.84,0:01:12.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以输入方式上会有些许不同
Dialogue: 2,0:01:09.84,0:01:12.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,the inputs had to be a little bit different.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:12.28,0:01:15.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是AGC的界面

Dialogue: 1,0:01:22.35,0:01:26.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,但和我们家用电脑的屏幕不太一样
Dialogue: 2,0:01:22.35,0:01:26.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's not a typical screen like we're used to using on our home computers.

Dialogue: 2,0:01:26.20,0:01:30.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,There aren't alphabetical keys and the screen doesn't list information in words.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:30.83,0:01:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上 它的键盘和我们使用过的完全不一样
Dialogue: 2,0:01:30.83,0:01:33.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, this keyboard is anything but common to us.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.87,0:01:36.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么宇航员是如何操控DSKY的呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.87,0:01:36.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how exactly did the astronauts use the DSKY?
Dialogue: 1,0:01:36.66,0:01:40.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,其实它为宇航员们提供了一种非常简单的交互方式
Dialogue: 2,0:01:36.66,0:01:40.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well it actually offered a very simplistic interface for crews.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:40.25,0:01:45.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,首先是上方的警示灯 COMP ACTY表示计算机正在运行程序
Dialogue: 2,0:01:40.25,0:01:45.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,Starting with the warning lights. COMP ACTY lit up when the computer was running a program.

Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.20,0:02:45.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Verb, Noun, Plus, Minus, numbers, and handful of command keys.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:45.95,0:02:51.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以显然没法敲一行类似“运行惯导平台校正程序”这样的命令进去
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.95,0:02:51.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there's no obvious way to write in a command like "run guidance platform alignment program,"
Dialogue: 1,0:02:51.41,0:02:55.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么宇航员是如何用DSKY与AGC交互的呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:02:51.41,0:02:55.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,so how exactly did the astronauts actually interface with the computer using the DSKY?
Dialogue: 1,0:02:55.96,0:02:58.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就要说到“动词/名词”形式了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:55.96,0:02:58.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, this is where nouns and verbs come in,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:58.25,0:03:01.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,想要理解这个 我们要先把宇宙飞船放在一边
Dialogue: 2,0:02:58.25,0:03:01.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,but to understand this we actually kind of need to leave the spacecraft for a second
Dialogue: 1,0:03:01.88,0:03:04.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,回到地面 比如咱们来到了纽约市大街上
Dialogue: 2,0:03:01.88,0:03:04.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and go down to maybe the streets of New York City.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:04.68,0:03:09.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,想象你在纽约旅游 你又不会说鸟语
Dialogue: 2,0:03:04.68,0:03:09.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,So imagine you're in New York City, you are a tourist, and you don't really speak any English;
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.26,0:03:12.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,自己脑子里只会大概五个词 而它们也不可能组成一句
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.26,0:03:12.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,you've got about five words in your arsenal, none of them include
Dialogue: 1,0:03:12.22,0:03:16.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,“您好 这个城市有啥好吃的餐馆吗？”这样的话
Dialogue: 2,0:03:12.22,0:03:16.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,"excuse me, but which way to a lovely restaurant in this fine neighborhood of the city?"
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.49,0:03:19.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是你找到一个警察 你觉得这人能带你到你想去的地方
Dialogue: 2,0:03:16.49,0:03:19.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you find a policeman knowing that this is the kind of person
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.46,0:03:22.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是你找到一个警察 你觉得这人能带你到你想去的地方
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.46,0:03:22.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,who might be able to direct you towards what it is you're looking for.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:22.44,0:03:28.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,你到警察面前 使用其中一个词告诉他你想要做什么
Dialogue: 2,0:03:22.44,0:03:28.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you go up to the policeman and you use one of your words to tell him what it is you want to do.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:28.26,0:03:31.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,那个词是“吃” 而“吃”是动词
Dialogue: 2,0:03:28.26,0:03:31.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,That word is "eat," and that is a verb.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:31.05,0:03:33.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,可纽约好吃的多了去了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:31.05,0:03:33.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there's a lot of food in New York City to choose from
Dialogue: 1,0:03:33.55,0:03:36.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你得指定你要吃什么
Dialogue: 2,0:03:33.55,0:03:36.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you have to define what it is you want to eat,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.28,0:03:40.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是你又说出了一个词“披萨” 这是个名词
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.28,0:03:40.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so you use one of your other words, "pizza," which is a noun.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:40.60,0:03:42.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,你听明白了吗？
Dialogue: 2,0:03:40.60,0:03:42.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,So do you see where we're going with this?
Dialogue: 1,0:03:42.64,0:03:46.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像你用小学二年级英语和警察叔叔对话的场景一样
Dialogue: 2,0:03:42.64,0:03:46.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just like your awkward, broken English conversation with the New York City policeman,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.75,0:03:50.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,AGC处理的所有数据都是用“动词/名词”形式传递的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.75,0:03:50.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,all data going through the Apollo guidance computer used verbs and nouns.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.70,0:03:53.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,用动词确定要执行的动作
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.70,0:03:53.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,The verb is defined as the action being taken
Dialogue: 1,0:03:53.57,0:03:56.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,用名词确定该动作执行在哪组数据上
Dialogue: 2,0:03:53.57,0:03:56.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the noun is defined as the data set being acted on.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:56.70,0:04:00.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们在现实中的计算机也有类似的操作
Dialogue: 2,0:03:56.70,0:04:00.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's actually a really simple computer-based version of this that we all use
Dialogue: 1,0:04:00.22,0:04:03.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是我们很多没有注意到 因为没人管它叫“动词/名词”
Dialogue: 2,0:04:00.22,0:04:03.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,but don't really think about because it's not expressed as a noun and a verb
Dialogue: 1,0:04:03.60,0:04:05.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个例子就是打印文件
Dialogue: 2,0:04:03.60,0:04:05.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,printing a document.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:05.02,0:04:07.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,你选择了“打印” 这就是动词
Dialogue: 2,0:04:05.02,0:04:07.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you select print, that is the verb.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:07.64,0:04:10.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,而对应的文件名就是名词 就是计算机要处理的数据（本例中数据就是文件）
Dialogue: 2,0:04:07.64,0:04:10.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,The file name is the noun, which is basically the data set
Dialogue: 1,0:04:10.99,0:04:14.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,而对应的文件名就是名词 就是计算机要处理的数据（本例中数据就是文件）
Dialogue: 2,0:04:10.99,0:04:14.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,(or in this case document) that that verb is acting on.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:14.11,0:04:19.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以宇航员就是这样用“动词/名词”将数据输入到AGC的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:14.11,0:04:19.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the astronauts inputted all their data using nouns and verbs into the Apollo guidance computer.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:19.55,0:04:24.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,动词名词各100种 各自定义了AGC在任务中会执行的程序
Dialogue: 2,0:04:19.55,0:04:24.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,There were 100 sets of noun verb pairs all defining a specific thing
Dialogue: 1,0:04:24.49,0:04:27.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,动词名词各100种 各自定义了AGC在任务中会执行的程序
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.49,0:04:27.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the Apollo guidance computer would do on a mission.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:27.28,0:04:30.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们来举个例子看看 如果你输入了 动词-37
Dialogue: 2,0:04:27.28,0:04:30.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's look at an example. Let's say you enter verb 37 --
