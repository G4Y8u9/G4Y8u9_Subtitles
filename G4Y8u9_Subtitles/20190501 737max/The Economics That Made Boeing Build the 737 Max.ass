Dialogue: 1,0:02:03.76,0:02:07.34,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,但波音之所以可能不会选择过早放弃737
Dialogue: 2,0:02:03.76,0:02:07.34,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,The reason Boeing might not have chosen to scrap the 737 earlier, though,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:07.34,0:02:12.20,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,是因为航空公司并不那么看重短途飞机的燃油效率
Dialogue: 2,0:02:07.34,0:02:12.20,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,is because, to airlines, fuel efficiency matters less for their short-haul planes.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:12.42,0:02:16.02,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,这部分原因单纯是因为小飞机每天飞行时间较短
Dialogue: 2,0:02:12.42,0:02:16.02,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,That’s partially just because smaller planes fly fewer hours per day.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:16.24,0:02:21.98,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,比如在美国航空公司中，窄体飞机每天平均飞行8.2小时
Dialogue: 2,0:02:16.24,0:02:21.98,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,Among American airlines, for example, the average small narrow-body plane spends 8.2 hours airborne per day
Dialogue: 1,0:02:22.02,0:02:26.00,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,而宽体飞机每天要飞11.5小时

Dialogue: 1,0:02:26.20,0:02:31.04,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,但同时，窄体飞机每天平均飞行4.5班次
Dialogue: 2,0:02:26.20,0:02:31.04,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,Meanwhile, though, the average small, narrow-body plane flies 4.5 flights per day
Dialogue: 1,0:02:31.04,0:02:34.38,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,而宽体飞机平均每天只飞1.5班次
Dialogue: 2,0:02:31.04,0:02:34.38,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,whereas the average wide-body flies just 1.5 per day.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:34.66,0:02:40.56,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,小型飞机飞的航线短，所以它们会花费更长的时间在地面上装货卸货
Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.66,0:02:40.56,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,Considering small planes fly shorter routes, they spend more time on the ground unloading and loading between flights.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:40.78,0:02:45.08,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,所以，更短的飞行时间让在燃油的花费上
Dialogue: 2,0:02:40.78,0:02:45.08,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,So, with fewer hours per day in the air, the proportion of cost devoted to fuel
Dialogue: 1,0:02:45.08,0:02:47.84,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,小飞机比大飞机更少
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.08,0:02:47.84,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,is lower to operate small planes than big planes.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:48.12,0:02:54.52,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,传统地讲，航司宁愿买便宜的小飞机，而不是昂贵的高效率的小飞机
Dialogue: 2,0:02:48.12,0:02:54.52,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,Traditionally, airlines would rather have a cheap, small plane rather than an expensive, super efficient small plane.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.76,0:02:58.46,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,737就是又小又便宜的飞机
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.76,0:02:58.46,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,The 737 is just that—it’s a cheap, small plane.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:58.62,0:03:06.68,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,737-700的标价只有8900万美元，实际成交价会比这更低
Dialogue: 2,0:02:58.62,0:03:06.68,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,The 737-700’s list price is only $89 million and, once airlines actually negotiate an order, the real price is far less.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:06.86,0:03:11.85,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,凭借半个多世纪的经验，波音的737制造工艺已经相当完善
Dialogue: 2,0:03:06.86,0:03:11.85,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,With over 50 years of experience, Boeing has perfected the 737 manufacturing process and
Dialogue: 1,0:03:11.85,0:03:15.00,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,因此能够以很低的价格交付飞机
Dialogue: 2,0:03:11.85,0:03:15.00,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,is therefore able to offer the plane at a relatively cheap price.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:15.20,0:03:19.82,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,波音最快的时候平均14小时就能造一架737
Dialogue: 2,0:03:15.20,0:03:19.82,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,At their peak, Boeing was making one 737 every 14 hours.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.94,0:03:23.14,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,所以总的来说，当航司考虑优先买哪种飞机的时候
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.94,0:03:23.14,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,So, in summary, when prioritizing which planes to buy,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.24,0:03:29.14,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,他们会青睐升级远程宽体飞机为最新、最省油的机型，而不是小飞机
Dialogue: 2,0:03:23.24,0:03:29.14,1080P_EN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,airlines are going to be more focused on upgrading their long-haul, wide-body fleets to the newest, most fuel-efficient airplanes
Dialogue: 1,0:03:29.14,0:03:30.45,1080P_CN_Bottom,,0,0,0,,他们会青睐升级远程宽体飞机为最新、最省油的机型，而不是小飞机
