Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.68,0:02:59.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,首先先大体了解一下火箭发动机的工作原理
Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.68,0:02:59.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first let's talk about how they work in general.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:59.48,0:03:02.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭发动机的工作原理非常简单
Dialogue: 2,0:02:59.48,0:03:02.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,A rocket engine functions under a simple concept,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.12,0:03:05.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,即在一段时间内 以尽量快的速度向后抛射物质
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.12,0:03:05.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,throw stuff out the back as fast as possible, period.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:05.58,0:03:08.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,抛射得越多 且抛射得越快
Dialogue: 2,0:03:05.58,0:03:08.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,The more stuff you can throw and the quicker you can shoot it out,

Dialogue: 2,0:03:08.74,0:03:10.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,the more thrust you can produce.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:10.64,0:03:15.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,产生的推力越多 能推动的燃料与载荷就越多
Dialogue: 2,0:03:10.64,0:03:15.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,The more thrust you can produce, the more stuff like fuel and payload you can lift.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:15.42,0:03:18.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样才有可能在太空飞得越远
Dialogue: 2,0:03:15.42,0:03:18.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the further you can potentially go in space.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.31,0:03:21.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,抛射尾气的速度称为排气速度
Dialogue: 2,0:03:18.31,0:03:21.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,The speed of your exhaust is known as exhaust gas velocity,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:21.76,0:03:26.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,它不但与火箭可以产生的推力正相关
Dialogue: 2,0:03:21.76,0:03:26.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's not only directly related to the thrust that pushes back on the vehicle,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:26.33,0:03:30.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,还与发动机的效率成正比
Dialogue: 2,0:03:26.33,0:03:30.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's also directly proportional to the efficiency of the engine.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:30.13,0:03:33.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以排气速度越快越好
Dialogue: 2,0:03:30.13,0:03:33.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the faster we throw propellant out the back, the better.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:33.53,0:03:36.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像枪或大炮产生后坐力一样
Dialogue: 2,0:03:33.53,0:03:36.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just like the recoil from a gun or a cannon.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.41,0:03:40.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们的基础都是牛顿第三定律
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.41,0:03:40.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the basic concept at play here, Newton's Third Law.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:40.69,0:03:43.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,两物体相互作用 彼此施加的力 大小相等 方向相反
Dialogue: 2,0:03:40.69,0:03:43.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,For each action there's an equal and opposite reaction.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:43.53,0:03:50.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是在火箭上我们射出去的不是子弹或炮弹 而是无数速度极快的气体分子
Dialogue: 2,0:03:43.53,0:03:50.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,Only instead of bullets or cannon balls, we're shooting tiny molecules of gas at ridiculously high velocities.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.44,0:03:55.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,实现方法是将火箭发动机燃烧室内的压力和更重要的热量(这点比较反直觉)
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.44,0:03:55.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,The way to do that is by converting pressure and though non intuitively much more important, heat,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:55.64,0:04:00.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,通过"拉瓦尔喷管" 或"收敛-扩张喷管"转化为动能

Dialogue: 2,0:04:09.38,0:04:13.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,into cooler, supersonic, lower pressure gas.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:13.12,0:04:18.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,其中的难点是让燃烧室内的压力与温度尽量高
Dialogue: 2,0:04:13.12,0:04:18.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,The challenge is getting the pressure and temperature as high as possible in the combustion chamber
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.79,0:04:20.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时还要控制好热量
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.79,0:04:20.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,while managing the heat.

Dialogue: 2,0:05:50.71,0:05:53.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,As the name suggests the engine runs cold,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:53.57,0:05:57.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,发动机内部没有燃烧或其他化学反应发生
Dialogue: 2,0:05:53.57,0:05:57.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,meaning there is no chemical reaction or combustion that occurs,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:57.24,0:06:02.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,单纯是储存的高压气体膨胀后流经喷管产生推力的过程
Dialogue: 2,0:05:57.24,0:06:02.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,just simply the expansion of a stored gas, through the nozzle, to produce thrust.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:02.21,0:06:07.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,称为冷气推进 单纯是因为气体在膨胀的时候温度会随之降低
Dialogue: 2,0:06:02.21,0:06:07.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the name is literal because when expanding a gas, the temperature drops too,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:07.56,0:06:10.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,即"焦耳-汤姆孙效应"
Dialogue: 2,0:06:07.56,0:06:10.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that's called the Joule–Thomson effect.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:10.26,0:06:14.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以它从物理上讲就是"冷"气推进发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:06:10.26,0:06:14.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it actually is physically a cold gas thruster.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:14.29,0:06:18.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,冷气推进发动机的最大局限就是体系内缺少热量与可用的压力

Dialogue: 2,0:06:18.05,0:06:20.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the available pressure in the system.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:20.69,0:06:23.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,别忘了那条规则 流体总是从高压流向低压
Dialogue: 2,0:06:20.69,0:06:23.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember our rule, pressure flows from high to low.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:23.76,0:06:28.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以为了得到足够的压力让发动机产生足够推力
Dialogue: 2,0:06:23.76,0:06:28.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in order to get high amounts of pressure and therefore thrust in the engine,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:28.26,0:06:33.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃料罐内的压力就要比发动机内还高
Dialogue: 2,0:06:28.26,0:06:33.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,it means the pressure in the tank always needs to be higher than it is in the engine.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:33.20,0:06:37.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以可以想象 燃料罐内储存燃料的压力就要越高越好
Dialogue: 2,0:06:33.20,0:06:37.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,As you can imagine, this means you'll want to store the propellant inside your tank

Dialogue: 1,0:06:42.55,0:06:45.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,但储存燃料的压力越高
Dialogue: 2,0:06:42.55,0:06:45.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the higher the pressure you store your propellant,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:45.68,0:06:48.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃料罐的厚度与重量也会随之增加
Dialogue: 2,0:06:45.68,0:06:48.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,the thicker and heavier your tanks will need to be.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:48.74,0:06:50.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,但毕竟这是火箭科学
Dialogue: 2,0:06:48.74,0:06:50.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is rocket science after all,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:50.92,0:06:56.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,厚重的燃料罐在绝大多数情况下都不是什么好事
Dialogue: 2,0:06:50.92,0:06:56.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,so thick and heavy tanks, aren't really a great option for most applications.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:56.35,0:06:58.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以经过权衡会发现 耐高压但过于厚重的燃料罐其实并不值得
Dialogue: 2,0:06:56.35,0:06:58.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,At some point, a trade-off occurs
Dialogue: 1,0:06:58.27,0:07:02.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以经过权衡会发现 耐高压但过于厚重的燃料罐其实并不值得
Dialogue: 2,0:06:58.27,0:07:02.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,where thicker and heavier tanks with higher pressure don't actually pay off
Dialogue: 1,0:07:02.44,0:07:06.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,体系中过了某个值后 再去追求更高压力反而越亏
Dialogue: 2,0:07:02.44,0:07:06.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's not worth it anymore to pursue a higher pressure in the system.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:06.28,0:07:11.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以工程师们转而研究能承受尽可能高压力 但又能尽可能轻巧的燃料罐

Dialogue: 2,0:27:32.89,0:27:37.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this means they decided to run all of the oxidizer through the turbine,
Dialogue: 1,0:27:37.72,0:27:40.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后把富氧燃气泵入主燃烧室
Dialogue: 2,0:27:37.72,0:27:40.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then pipe that into the main combustion chamber.

Dialogue: 2,0:27:57.94,0:28:01.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what's our rule, pressure always flows from high to low.
Dialogue: 1,0:28:01.47,0:28:06.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以预燃室内的压力要比主燃烧室压力高
Dialogue: 2,0:28:01.47,0:28:06.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the pressure inside the preburner needs to much higher than the combustion chamber.

Dialogue: 1,0:28:41.74,0:28:46.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为所有氧化剂都要流经涡轮 所以都会被加到非常非常高的压力
Dialogue: 2,0:28:41.74,0:28:46.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,All of the oxidizer will get compressed up to very, very high pressure
Dialogue: 1,0:28:46.06,0:28:48.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为所有氧化剂都要流经涡轮 所以都会被加到非常非常高的压力

Dialogue: 2,0:28:48.79,0:28:51.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that same thing isn't true for the fuel.
Dialogue: 1,0:28:51.16,0:28:54.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,绝大多数燃料都直接泵入了主燃烧室
Dialogue: 2,0:28:51.16,0:28:54.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,The majority of the fuel will just flow into the combustion chamber.
Dialogue: 1,0:28:54.50,0:28:59.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以压力只要加到比燃烧室高20%就行了
Dialogue: 2,0:28:54.50,0:28:59.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it only needs to be pressurized to about that 20% higher pressure than the combustion chamber,
Dialogue: 1,0:28:59.73,0:29:05.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我们还需要一些足够高压的燃料去预燃室里做功

Dialogue: 1,0:29:05.51,0:29:09.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以此时 泵被分成了多级
Dialogue: 2,0:29:05.51,0:29:09.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, there's actually stages to the pump.
Dialogue: 1,0:29:09.45,0:29:12.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,绝大多数燃料流经第一级 达到足够压力后就泵进了主燃烧室

Dialogue: 1,0:29:18.94,0:29:22.84,辉中,,1000,0,0,,继续提高压力 供给预燃室
Dialogue: 2,0:29:18.94,0:29:22.84,辉英,,1000,0,0,,that increases the pressure to be high enough pressure for the preburner.

Dialogue: 1,0:29:31.53,0:29:35.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,原因是之前只有一小部分燃料参与了反应
Dialogue: 2,0:29:31.53,0:29:35.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, since there was only a dash of fuel to react with,
