Dialogue: 1,0:00:00.10,0:00:03.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,寂静岭PT是一款谜一般的现象级游戏
Dialogue: 2,0:00:00.10,0:00:03.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,PT is the definition of an enigmatic phenomenon.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:03.81,0:00:08.54,辉中,,700,0,0,,当这款试玩版游戏在PS4平台发布时
Dialogue: 2,0:00:03.81,0:00:08.54,辉英,,700,0,0,,When the small game or teaser demo launched on the Playstation 4,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:08.54,0:00:12.22,辉中,,700,0,0,,完全没有任何提示 任何宣发 任何发布会
Dialogue: 2,0:00:08.54,0:00:12.22,辉英,,700,0,0,,there was no warning, no forward, no press release, hell,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:12.22,0:00:18.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至据所有人所知 游戏里所谓的制作组也根本不存在
Dialogue: 2,0:00:12.22,0:00:18.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,even the studio listed as having developed it didn't exist, as far as anybody could tell.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:18.94,0:00:26.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,简单来说 这游戏就像凭空冒出来一样
Dialogue: 2,0:00:18.94,0:00:26.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Simply, the game was a complete unknown coming out of nowhere, from seemingly no one.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:26.76,0:00:30.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的一个开始就已经够奇葩的了
Dialogue: 2,0:00:26.76,0:00:30.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, that by itself is very suspicious and strange to begin with.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:30.57,0:00:35.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,你或许可能会以为这游戏是某个steam上青睐之光的作品
Dialogue: 2,0:00:30.57,0:00:35.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe you could explain it away, if it were some sort of steam green light title that ...
Dialogue: 1,0:00:35.47,0:00:40.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,由西伯利亚哪个工棚里做出来的
Dialogue: 2,0:00:35.47,0:00:40.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,was from some unknown developer in the middle of nowhere in Siberia.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:40.28,0:00:43.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这款游戏的质量却相当好
Dialogue: 2,0:00:40.28,0:00:43.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in this case, the game was actually pretty good.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:43.80,0:00:49.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然流程很短 但游戏画面 从一开始就让人感觉牛逼
Dialogue: 2,0:00:43.80,0:00:49.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Granted it was short, but graphically, the second it was booted up, it was outstanding.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:49.85,0:00:56.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,当时还是2014年的8月 这种画面简直是现象级的
Dialogue: 2,0:00:49.85,0:00:56.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially at the time back in August of 2014, this was graphically phenomenal.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:56.56,0:01:00.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,作为对比 那年还出了《刺客信条：大革命》
Dialogue: 2,0:00:56.56,0:01:00.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,To put it in perspective, that was the same year that Assassin's Creed Unity launched,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:00.73,0:01:05.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,该游戏在当时已经是令玩家激动到窒息的游戏了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:00.73,0:01:05.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that was considered to be one of the most ... breathtaking games ever.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:05.09,0:01:08.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然游戏发售后才发现 确实挺窒息的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:05.09,0:01:08.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean and then the game launched, and people changed their mind on that.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:08.61,0:01:15.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,而PT这款凭空出现的游戏 画面精美 品质上乘 甚至在整个行业都是领先的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:08.61,0:01:15.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the point is that PT came out of nowhere and looked fantastic, cutting edge, even industry leading.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:15.99,0:01:20.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时 它又非常有创造力 非常独特
Dialogue: 2,0:01:15.99,0:01:20.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,In addition, it was creative and very, very unique.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:20.29,0:01:26.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,为避免大家不了解 或者有点忘了 提醒一下 PT的场景是一条无限循环的走廊
Dialogue: 2,0:01:20.29,0:01:26.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,In case you're not aware, or if you just need a jog to your memory, PT is set in a never ending hallway.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:26.74,0:01:33.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家多次经过这条走廊 基于每次的行动 会有些许的变化
Dialogue: 2,0:01:26.74,0:01:31.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,The player goes through a ton of different cycles of this hallway with its slowly changing and updating,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:31.99,0:01:33.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,based on the things that you do.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.53,0:01:41.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样平凡的场景却时时刻刻让人感觉到不安与恐惧
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.53,0:01:41.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,The setting is equally unsettling and terrifying, all at the same time of being remarkably mundane.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:41.18,0:01:44.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 你找一个碳基生物做一个恐怖游戏的场景
Dialogue: 2,0:01:41.18,0:01:44.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, seriously, if you were going to design a horror game,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:44.90,0:01:54.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,肯定不会想到把你家房子前厅和走廊设计成直接相连的样式
Dialogue: 2,0:01:44.90,0:01:48.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,chances are one of the last places you would think to place it
Dialogue: 2,0:01:48.86,0:01:54.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be in the front foyer of your house with the hallway directly adjacent.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.42,0:01:58.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,这太怪了 但实际效果却好得不行
Dialogue: 2,0:01:54.42,0:01:58.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's very bizarre, and yet it works so well.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:58.73,0:02:01.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,这款游戏真的够罕见的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:58.73,0:02:01.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,Really, it's one of those rare forms of horror games
Dialogue: 1,0:02:01.82,0:02:05.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,乍一看完全不像是想吓唬人
Dialogue: 2,0:02:01.82,0:02:05.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,that doesn't really seem as though it's trying to scare you.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:05.62,0:02:07.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,而事实上 即使放到现在也很罕见
Dialogue: 2,0:02:05.62,0:02:07.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, it's really rare nowadays.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:07.61,0:02:14.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,我写这视频的台本时 要发售的一款恐怖题材的恐怖游戏
Dialogue: 2,0:02:07.61,0:02:09.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,As of the time of writing this script,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:09.21,0:02:14.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,the most recent horror game that was to come out, dedicated to the horror genre
Dialogue: 1,0:02:14.28,0:02:19.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,是《黑相集》系列的《黑相集：稀望镇》
Dialogue: 2,0:02:14.28,0:02:19.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,was within The Dark Pictures Anthology, specifically the game Little Hope,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:19.16,0:02:21.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你让我做那款游戏的评测
Dialogue: 2,0:02:19.16,0:02:21.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,which ... if you want me to do a critique,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:21.81,0:02:26.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我可不困了 我可要好好告诉你《黑相集》系列有多垃圾
Dialogue: 2,0:02:21.81,0:02:26.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,breaking down why I hate these Dark Pictures games, I would be happy to do it.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:26.70,0:02:30.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,那阵还干过不少烂事 因为我真气坏了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:26.70,0:02:30.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are some of the worst things I've ever done, I was legitimately upset.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:30.18,0:02:34.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,我去年还花钱买了《黑相集：棉兰号》 当然那是题外话
Dialogue: 2,0:02:30.18,0:02:34.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,I spent money on Man of Medan back last year, but that's beside the point.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:34.97,0:02:39.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,重点是 这系列游戏真的很烂 他们绞尽脑汁来吓唬你
Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.97,0:02:39.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,Point is, those games are terrible, and they try so hard to scare you
Dialogue: 1,0:02:39.79,0:02:42.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果却一丁点都不吓人
Dialogue: 2,0:02:39.79,0:02:42.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,that it ends up being totally unterrifying.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.90,0:02:48.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,反观PT 游戏并没有什么刻意吓唬人的元素
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.90,0:02:48.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the other side of the corn is PT, a game that doesn't do almost anything to scare you.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:48.49,0:02:52.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,完全没有束手束脚的操作
Dialogue: 2,0:02:48.49,0:02:52.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,It also doesn't do anything to hold your hand.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:52.24,0:02:54.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点我们马上会提
Dialogue: 2,0:02:52.24,0:02:54.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something that we're going to talk a little bit more about in a second.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.95,0:02:57.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,一个游戏的核心应当是有某种机制在里面的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.95,0:02:57.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see a game at its core has to have some sort of mechanic,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:57.59,0:03:00.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,应当有某种需要玩家去解决的难题
Dialogue: 2,0:02:57.59,0:03:00.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,some sort of struggle that the player is trying to resolve.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:00.77,0:03:05.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果没有要解决的目标 或是没有任何难度 那这款游戏就会变成步行模拟器
Dialogue: 2,0:03:00.77,0:03:05.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,A game that doesn't have any sort of struggle or difficulty, is ... just a walking simulator.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:05.98,0:03:10.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多玩家也因此对某些游戏表达了失望与批评
Dialogue: 2,0:03:05.98,0:03:10.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,And many people have expressed frustration and levied this very criticism against certain games
Dialogue: 1,0:03:10.58,0:03:14.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,诸如顽皮狗的系列游戏 或者《死亡搁浅》这样的游戏
Dialogue: 2,0:03:10.58,0:03:14.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,such as Naughty Dog titles, or even something like Death stranding
Dialogue: 1,0:03:14.71,0:03:19.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们评价游戏是“步行模拟器 没有足够要解决的难题”
Dialogue: 2,0:03:14.71,0:03:19.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,for being a quote, unquote, "walking simulator: a game that doesn't have enough struggle".
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.65,0:03:23.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一种说法是如果游戏没有足够的难度
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.65,0:03:23.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another way of putting this is when a game doesn't have enough difficulty,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.20,0:03:27.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,就会让玩家无法足够参与进游戏中来
Dialogue: 2,0:03:23.20,0:03:27.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,it ... leads the player into a situation where they don't have to engage,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:27.05,0:03:30.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,无法与游戏共进退
Dialogue: 2,0:03:27.05,0:03:30.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,hardly at all with the game itself to progress.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:30.24,0:03:33.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家应该和游戏在同一条船上 共同从A到B
Dialogue: 2,0:03:30.24,0:03:33.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Effectively, they're on train tracks, going from point A to point B.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:33.73,0:03:38.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种情况下你能讲出一个有趣的故事 但很难能让玩家参与其中
Dialogue: 2,0:03:33.73,0:03:38.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can tell an interesting story that way, but it's not actually that engaging.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:38.44,0:03:44.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,也因此 这样的游戏我通常称之为“视觉小说” 而不是一般的电子游戏
Dialogue: 2,0:03:38.44,0:03:44.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's why, I would say games such as that are much closer to "visual novels" than they are - video games.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:45.04,0:03:48.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏对我来说需要某种程度的互动
Dialogue: 2,0:03:45.04,0:03:48.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,Games to me require some level of interaction.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:48.03,0:03:54.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,而现在 PT非常精巧地骑在了游戏与视觉小说的那条分界线上
Dialogue: 2,0:03:48.03,0:03:54.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now PT straddles that line between game and visual storytelling very finely.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:54.98,0:03:58.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为游戏中有你必须去互动才能解决的谜题
Dialogue: 2,0:03:54.98,0:03:58.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Specifically, because it has puzzles that you have to interact with to progress.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:58.68,0:04:03.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你不可能绕着相同的走廊走他50圈然后通关游戏
Dialogue: 2,0:03:58.68,0:04:03.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can't just walk through the hallway fifty times and experience the game start to finish.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:03.58,0:04:07.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,你必须切身参与进游戏的某种机制中去 才能推进游戏
Dialogue: 2,0:04:03.58,0:04:07.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to actively engage in certain mechanisms in order to progress,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:07.56,0:04:13.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,而PT这款游戏背后的机制实在是{\fs120}非常非常{\fs65}让人捉摸不透
Dialogue: 2,0:04:07.56,0:04:13.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,that being said, the mechanisms that you have to engage with are {\fs50}VERY VERY {\fs35}vague.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:14.26,0:04:25.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,模糊到相当多的玩家不去查攻略 查外部资料的情况下根本没法通关
Dialogue: 2,0:04:14.26,0:04:19.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, it's so vague that many people are unable to go through this game from start to finish
Dialogue: 2,0:04:19.64,0:04:25.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,without looking up some sort of guide or receiving some level of assistance from an outside source.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:25.13,0:04:31.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,最好的例子就是整个游戏里结尾的谜题
Dialogue: 2,0:04:25.13,0:04:31.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,The most specific example of this would be the final puzzle of the teaser, that is PT.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:31.53,0:04:36.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,小岛秀夫作为整个游戏体验的设计者与导演
Dialogue: 2,0:04:31.53,0:04:36.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see Hideo Kojima, the lead designer and director of this whole experience
Dialogue: 1,0:04:36.30,0:04:40.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,他认为游戏的关键是不断的试错
Dialogue: 2,0:04:36.30,0:04:40.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,expected that trial and error was going to be key.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:40.97,0:04:45.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,他在涉及所有谜题与游戏体验时
Dialogue: 2,0:04:40.97,0:04:45.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,And he designed all of these puzzles, and this experience in general,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:45.21,0:04:48.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,首先想到的就是这点
Dialogue: 2,0:04:45.21,0:04:48.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,with that first and foremost in his mind.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:48.39,0:04:56.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外 小岛秀夫当时估计游戏界要花大概一周才能破解游戏里的谜题
Dialogue: 2,0:04:48.39,0:04:52.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, Kojima also expected it to take roughly a week
Dialogue: 2,0:04:52.93,0:04:56.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the gaming community to finish the taser trailer.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:57.10,0:05:00.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,但根据2014年的一些统计来看
Dialogue: 2,0:04:57.10,0:05:00.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,Though, by some accounts, from back in 2014,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:00.28,0:05:04.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然一些玩家只花了几小时就通关了
Dialogue: 2,0:05:00.28,0:05:04.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,apparently, some people only required a few hours to get through all of these puzzles,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:04.66,0:05:09.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论当时是巧合还是几个主播一起合作完成还是其他方法
Dialogue: 2,0:05:04.66,0:05:07.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether it was coincidence or working together with other streamers,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:07.85,0:05:09.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,or whatever it may have been at the time.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:09.87,0:05:12.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,反正留下来的记录太少了
Dialogue: 2,0:05:09.87,0:05:12.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's pretty much been lost to history at this point.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:12.58,0:05:17.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,但有报告说有玩家只花五小时就通关了
Dialogue: 2,0:05:12.58,0:05:17.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there were reports some people were able to get through in as few as four to five hours.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:17.08,0:05:19.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我对游戏本身的谜题看法很矛盾
Dialogue: 2,0:05:17.08,0:05:19.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I'm really conflicted on these puzzles.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:19.93,0:05:27.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们太模糊了 玩家只能靠瞎蒙才能找到某些解决办法
Dialogue: 2,0:05:19.93,0:05:24.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are SO vague that it requires the player to effectively guess
Dialogue: 2,0:05:24.84,0:05:27.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,in order to come up with some sort of solution
Dialogue: 1,0:05:27.46,0:05:31.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,要么就是问问通关的人他们怎么过的
