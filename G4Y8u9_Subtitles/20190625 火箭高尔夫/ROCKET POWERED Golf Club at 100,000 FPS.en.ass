Dialogue: 2,0:00:09.73,0:00:15.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,But using two F sized motors she swings at 150 miles per hour, every time
Dialogue: 1,0:00:15.94,0:00:19.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,我通常只会给你们看节目中造的东西的成品
Dialogue: 2,0:00:15.94,0:00:19.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,Usually for builds on my channel I just show you guys the final thing
Dialogue: 1,0:00:19.13,0:00:21.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,但几乎没怎么讲过整个制作流程是怎样的
Dialogue: 2,0:00:19.13,0:00:21.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,and don't really talk about the process of how we got there
Dialogue: 1,0:00:21.99,0:00:25.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,但放心，本期视频我们将看到固推神教
Dialogue: 2,0:00:21.99,0:00:25.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,But rest assured, today, we will get to see huge drives

Dialogue: 2,0:00:32.66,0:00:34.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,and even a handheld version
Dialogue: 1,0:00:36.10,0:00:39.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得这个作品是一个让大家了解幕后工程设计流程的绝好机会
Dialogue: 2,0:00:36.10,0:00:39.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this build, I think, is a great chance to pull back the curtain
Dialogue: 1,0:00:39.08,0:00:42.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得这个作品是一个让大家了解幕后工程设计流程的绝好机会
Dialogue: 2,0:00:39.08,0:00:42.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,and demonstrate how the engineering design process actually works
Dialogue: 1,0:00:42.29,0:00:47.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想为你们传授六点……让我们一步步完成这个作品的“经验教训”
Dialogue: 2,0:00:42.29,0:00:47.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to highlight six- "learning opportunities" that led us to this final design
Dialogue: 1,0:00:47.21,0:00:51.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,为此，我们需要回到四个月前，我最开始想出这个点子的时候
Dialogue: 2,0:00:47.21,0:00:51.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and to do that, We need to go back in time four months to when I first had the idea
Dialogue: 1,0:00:51.02,0:00:53.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,和往常一样，我们从一个很简单的原型开始
Dialogue: 2,0:00:51.02,0:00:53.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as always we started with a simple prototype
Dialogue: 1,0:00:53.61,0:00:56.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,来了解这个想法是否有丝毫的可行性
Dialogue: 2,0:00:53.61,0:00:56.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,to see if the concept even had a remote chance of working
Dialogue: 1,0:00:57.08,0:01:00.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在点火之前，你会注意到我在另一端放了配重
Dialogue: 2,0:00:57.08,0:01:00.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before we fire it up, you'll notice we have counterweights on the opposite side here
Dialogue: 1,0:01:01.06,0:01:05.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是为了让重心刚好能在旋转轴上
Dialogue: 2,0:01:01.06,0:01:05.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's so that the center of mass of the spinning part is on top of the axis of rotation
Dialogue: 1,0:01:05.74,0:01:10.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说，它在旋转轴的位置能刚好保持平衡
Dialogue: 2,0:01:05.74,0:01:10.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,In other words, It balances perfectly at the point at which it spins around
Dialogue: 1,0:01:10.13,0:01:12.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果不这样的话
Dialogue: 2,0:01:10.13,0:01:12.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you don't do that for something that spins
Dialogue: 1,0:01:12.10,0:01:14.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,你的系统就需要克服它在旋转时产生的大量额外的力
Dialogue: 2,0:01:12.10,0:01:14.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,it creates a bunch of extra force for your system to deal with
Dialogue: 1,0:01:14.80,0:01:19.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,一开始只是震动，但加速之后会越来越难顶
Dialogue: 2,0:01:14.80,0:01:19.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,It starts as a small vibration, but then it gets worse and worse as you pick up speed
Dialogue: 1,0:01:19.49,0:01:23.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我们还要用高速的杆头击球
Dialogue: 2,0:01:19.49,0:01:23.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Since we needed to hit this tiny ball with the head of this club at really high speeds
Dialogue: 1,0:01:23.72,0:01:25.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以如果不平衡
Dialogue: 2,0:01:23.72,0:01:25.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,|if we're not perfectly balanced
Dialogue: 1,0:01:25.37,0:01:30.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,那球杆连着平台都会发生震动，那就甭想击球了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:25.37,0:01:30.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,the club and the whole platform itself will just be shaking all over the place and we'd never hit it
Dialogue: 1,0:01:30.60,0:01:31.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,OK，回到测试部分
Dialogue: 2,0:01:30.60,0:01:31.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK, back to the test
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.81,0:01:35.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,平台震动的比想象中大
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.81,0:01:35.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,Those stands are shaking more than they should
Dialogue: 1,0:01:35.58,0:01:39.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我觉得在实际测试中要继续改进旋转部分的平衡
Dialogue: 2,0:01:35.58,0:01:39.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we knew we would need to balance the spinning part better for the real test
Dialogue: 1,0:01:39.26,0:01:42.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,但至少我们知道它转得还算快，而且没炸
Dialogue: 2,0:01:39.26,0:01:42.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,But at least we knew it could go kind of fast and nothing blows up
Dialogue: 1,0:01:42.37,0:01:45.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后就到了计算机辅助设计的时候了，一般下一步都是这个
Dialogue: 2,0:01:42.37,0:01:45.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so then it was time for CAD which is always the next step
Dialogue: 1,0:01:45.28,0:01:49.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我和我的朋友Ken和Kayla开始切金属造东西了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:45.28,0:01:49.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then together with my friends, Ken and Kayla, we started cutting metal and making stuff
Dialogue: 1,0:02:03.60,0:02:04.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,组装很顺利
Dialogue: 2,0:02:03.60,0:02:04.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Things came together well
Dialogue: 1,0:02:04.88,0:02:08.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是我们把一个3D打印的固推固定装置粘在了杆头上
Dialogue: 2,0:02:04.88,0:02:08.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we epoxied a 3d printed motor mount to the top of the driver
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.08,0:02:13.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后草草开始了我们第一次实测，安全起见周围用网围了起来
Dialogue: 2,0:02:08.08,0:02:13.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,and prepped our first real test by taking one of those easy ups and draping some nets on the side for safety
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.20,0:02:15.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,以防万一发生危险
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.20,0:02:15.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,just in case something went catastrophically wrong
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.52,0:02:34.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是我们第二个教训，固推固定装置和杆头粘合的接触面太小
Dialogue: 2,0:02:29.52,0:02:34.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was our second learning experience, we didn't have enough contact area for epoxying the head to the driver
Dialogue: 1,0:02:34.54,0:02:35.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致粘合不牢
Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.54,0:02:35.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it wasn't a strong enough bond
Dialogue: 1,0:02:36.10,0:02:40.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,这步就很秀了，我们3D扫描了杆头，重新用CAD设计了新的固定装置
Dialogue: 2,0:02:36.10,0:02:40.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,this was tricky because it meant we had to 3d scan the club head which allowed us to CAD up
Dialogue: 1,0:02:40.84,0:02:45.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后3D打印了一个粘合接触面更大的固推固定装置
Dialogue: 2,0:02:40.84,0:02:45.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then 3d print a more contoured mount with more contact area for the epoxy
Dialogue: 1,0:02:45.08,0:02:49.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们还增加了一个固推摆放位，毕竟这能有多危险？
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.08,0:02:49.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,We also took this chance to double the rocket holsters because what could possibly go wrong?
Dialogue: 1,0:02:49.36,0:02:54.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是我们又去测试新的双发E号固推，一切顺利
Dialogue: 2,0:02:49.36,0:02:54.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we went to test our new dual rocket set up with two e motors and everything went perfectly
Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.19,0:02:58.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,除了球杆掉脑袋的部分
Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.19,0:02:58.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,Except for the part where the head snapped off the driver
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.22,0:03:06.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,当我们回看高速录像时我注意到球杆太软了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.22,0:03:06.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when we reviewed the slow-mo footage what we realized was the shaft of the driver is so flexible
Dialogue: 1,0:03:06.58,0:03:10.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致球杆会变弯，让推力方向产生变化
Dialogue: 2,0:03:06.58,0:03:10.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,that it would start to bend and then create really weird thrust vectors for the rockets
Dialogue: 1,0:03:10.38,0:03:13.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而进一步加剧球杆变弯，这是我们不想看到的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:10.38,0:03:13.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,which then just bent the shaft even more. This is not what you want to see
Dialogue: 1,0:03:13.98,0:03:17.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终超过球杆耐弯折的限度后，杆头就飞出去了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:13.98,0:03:17.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,Eventually it succeeded the stress limit of the shaft and the head just came off
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.84,0:03:22.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以第三条教训就是要加固球杆
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.84,0:03:22.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,So our third learning opportunity was to stiffen up the club shaft
Dialogue: 1,0:03:22.81,0:03:24.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是我们拿来C形铝条固定球杆
Dialogue: 2,0:03:22.81,0:03:24.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we got some aluminum C-channel
Dialogue: 1,0:03:24.45,0:03:27.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,里面灌满胶水，效果相当不错
Dialogue: 2,0:03:24.45,0:03:27.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,and just dumped a butt ton of epoxy in there and this worked remarkably
Dialogue: 1,0:03:27.53,0:03:29.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,你能看出前后区别
Dialogue: 2,0:03:27.53,0:03:29.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, you can see the difference here
Dialogue: 1,0:03:29.14,0:03:33.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,接着我们拿着它来到了遥远的“发射场”，美丽的加州北部
Dialogue: 2,0:03:29.14,0:03:33.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so with that we headed out to a very remote shooting location in beautiful, northern, California
Dialogue: 1,0:03:38.26,0:03:42.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,终于到啦，开始卸货架设备，但在之前我要先说一个事
Dialogue: 2,0:03:38.26,0:03:42.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we finally arrived and started to set up but first I have something I wanted to get off my chest
Dialogue: 1,0:03:42.77,0:03:47.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,我这个人吧，有一个爱好，就是吧……
Dialogue: 2,0:03:42.77,0:03:47.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,so one of the things I like most about me is that I will…
Dialogue: 1,0:03:48.08,0:03:54.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,我喜欢找一些不那么知名的YouTuber，在我的节目中帮他们火一把
Dialogue: 2,0:03:48.08,0:03:54.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,I like to reach out to lesser known channels and sort of give them a hand out at some exposure on my channel
Dialogue: 1,0:03:54.74,0:03:59.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以女士们先生们，有请SmarterEveryDay频道的Destin
Dialogue: 2,0:03:54.74,0:03:59.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is why today I'm here with Destin in SmarterEveryDay
Dialogue: 1,0:03:59.14,0:04:00.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你奇迹般地只知道我却不知道Destin
Dialogue: 2,0:03:59.14,0:04:00.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if by some miracle you don't know
Dialogue: 1,0:04:00.93,0:04:03.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,他那大脑袋都能登上科普类YouTuber里的总统山了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:00.93,0:04:03.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,Destin is on the Mount Rushmore of science youtubers
Dialogue: 1,0:04:03.66,0:04:06.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,我和他是将近六年的老交情了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:03.66,0:04:06.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,we've been friends for almost exactly six years
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.05,0:04:09.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,我记得特清楚是因为他订阅我频道的时候我激动地特意了截图
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.05,0:04:09.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I know this because I took a screenshot of the huge moment for me when he subscribed to my channel
Dialogue: 1,0:04:09.97,0:04:11.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,当时我还只有一万订阅
Dialogue: 2,0:04:09.97,0:04:11.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,when I only had 10,000 subs
Dialogue: 1,0:04:11.54,0:04:16.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,他做过的视频讲过有关猫着陆的物理知识，放过纹身时慢放的画面
Dialogue: 2,0:04:11.54,0:04:16.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,he's made videos about the physics of cats landing on their feet, tattoos in super slow-mo
Dialogue: 1,0:04:16.30,0:04:20.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,还有他第一个视频中讲解了配备内部开放反馈回路的鸡头稳定系统
Dialogue: 2,0:04:16.30,0:04:20.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the first video I saw of him about how chickens have an internal open feedback loop
Dialogue: 1,0:04:20.55,0:04:21.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,还有他第一个视频中讲解了配备内部开放反馈回路的鸡头稳定系统
Dialogue: 2,0:04:20.55,0:04:21.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,which allows them to head track
Dialogue: 1,0:04:21.85,0:04:24.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,你要是没看过的话那我可太羡慕你了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:21.85,0:04:24.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you've never seen his stuff I'm actually jealous
Dialogue: 1,0:04:24.65,0:04:28.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为你突然有了好几个小时的高质量视频可以看了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.65,0:04:28.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you have so many hours of high-quality viewing in your near future
Dialogue: 1,0:04:28.61,0:04:30.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,我爱高尔夫
Dialogue: 2,0:04:28.61,0:04:30.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I like golf
Dialogue: 1,0:04:30.61,0:04:31.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,我爱火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:04:30.61,0:04:31.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,I like rockets
Dialogue: 1,0:04:33.06,0:04:36.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,-真要整这出吗？-哎呀就……好歹有个开场白吧？-对，就当开场白了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:33.06,0:04:36.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should we do this? Yeah, let's just... That that was the intro right? That was it. Whatever
Dialogue: 1,0:04:37.26,0:04:38.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们就继续架设备了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:37.26,0:04:38.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we all continued to set up
Dialogue: 1,0:04:38.77,0:04:43.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,有一点我觉得很重要，就是让它尽可能像一个发球区
Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.77,0:04:43.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and something that was important to me was for this to look as natural as possible at a driving range
Dialogue: 1,0:04:43.32,0:04:45.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是我们给基座加了块草皮

Dialogue: 1,0:04:45.52,0:04:49.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,把又粗又黑的钢制立柱围了一圈球杆袋
Dialogue: 2,0:04:45.52,0:04:49.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then dissected a golf bag to cover the sturdy steel column
Dialogue: 1,0:04:49.05,0:04:51.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后里面插几个球杆，这样看上去帅多了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:49.05,0:04:51.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then if you add some clubs it looks pretty awesome
Dialogue: 1,0:04:51.35,0:04:54.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,不但很稳固，还能灵活旋转
Dialogue: 2,0:04:51.35,0:04:54.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's incredibly rigid and yet it can still swing freely
Dialogue: 1,0:04:54.22,0:04:57.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们第四条经验来自于回顾最终测试画面的声音过程中
Dialogue: 2,0:04:54.22,0:04:57.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Our fourth learning experience came from reviewing our final test footage
Dialogue: 1,0:04:57.52,0:05:00.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,仔细听会发现球杆转得越来越快
Dialogue: 2,0:04:57.52,0:05:00.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you listen, the club goes faster and faster with each rotation
Dialogue: 1,0:05:04.77,0:05:08.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,通常我们想让球杆在转的最快的时候击球
Dialogue: 2,0:05:04.77,0:05:08.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,Naturally we want the club to contact the ball when it's going the fastest
Dialogue: 1,0:05:08.67,0:05:12.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这个例子里是每秒十圈
Dialogue: 2,0:05:08.67,0:05:12.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,which in our case is ten rotations in one second
Dialogue: 1,0:05:12.02,0:05:16.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味着我们需要在十分之一秒的时间内把球放在球杆的路径上
Dialogue: 2,0:05:12.02,0:05:16.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means we somehow need to sneak the ball into the path of the driver in less than 1/10 of a second
Dialogue: 1,0:05:16.50,0:05:17.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者一次眨眼的1/4
Dialogue: 2,0:05:16.50,0:05:17.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,or a quarter of an eyeblink
Dialogue: 1,0:05:17.95,0:05:21.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,为了做到此事我做了个气动推杆把球推上去
Dialogue: 2,0:05:17.95,0:05:21.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,to accomplish this we have a pneumatic cylinder here that hinges up the tee
Dialogue: 1,0:05:21.57,0:05:22.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,它可以检测到何时启动
Dialogue: 2,0:05:21.57,0:05:22.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,It knows when to fire
Dialogue: 1,0:05:22.67,0:05:24.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为在球杆转轴的后面有一个光传感器
Dialogue: 2,0:05:22.67,0:05:24.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,because on the back of the shaft there's a light sensor
Dialogue: 1,0:05:24.72,0:05:29.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,而中间的圆盘有一个开口在每次旋转时可以让光通过
Dialogue: 2,0:05:24.72,0:05:29.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this disc has a slit which allows the light to pass through once per rotation
Dialogue: 1,0:05:29.72,0:05:32.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们把这个信号送到Arduino板上帮我计数
Dialogue: 2,0:05:29.72,0:05:32.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we send that info to an Arduino over here that counts for us
Dialogue: 1,0:05:32.87,0:05:34.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,在15次旋转后
Dialogue: 2,0:05:32.87,0:05:34.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then after 15 rotations
Dialogue: 1,0:05:34.25,0:05:38.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,它使用电磁开关来告知推杆准确伸出的时间
Dialogue: 2,0:05:34.25,0:05:38.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,it tells the cylinder the precise moment to fire using a solenoid
Dialogue: 1,0:05:38.79,0:05:40.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我用强力胶水把球粘在了白色杆的末端
Dialogue: 2,0:05:38.79,0:05:40.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we superglue the ball to the tee
Dialogue: 1,0:05:40.70,0:05:44.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这个力非常大，所以首先要保证球固定好，然后再让它能飞出去
Dialogue: 2,0:05:40.70,0:05:44.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it provides the Goldilocks amount of force to first secure and then release the ball
Dialogue: 1,0:05:44.95,0:05:47.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外慢动作下的强力胶水看上去很酷炫
Dialogue: 2,0:05:44.95,0:05:47.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus the superglue looks super dope in slow-mo
Dialogue: 1,0:05:51.30,0:05:54.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,一切准备就绪，我们先装两个E号的固推
Dialogue: 2,0:05:51.30,0:05:54.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now with everything in place we started with two e motors
Dialogue: 1,0:05:54.05,0:05:57.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是和之前把杆头甩掉的是一个构型
Dialogue: 2,0:05:54.05,0:05:57.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a reminder is the same setup that ripped the club head off
Dialogue: 1,0:05:57.75,0:06:00.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,3，2，1，走你！
Dialogue: 2,0:05:57.75,0:06:00.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,three two, one roll
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.92,0:06:22.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,那球飞过那些树了！
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.67,0:06:26.05,辉中,,0,0,150,,它起飞了！
Dialogue: 1,0:06:14.25,0:06:16.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,哪去了？咋回事啊？
Dialogue: 2,0:06:14.25,0:06:16.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where'd it go? What happened?
Dialogue: 1,0:06:16.32,0:06:17.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,液！北鼻！
Dialogue: 2,0:06:16.32,0:06:17.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,YEAH, BABY!!
Dialogue: 1,0:06:23.90,0:06:25.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,不是吧
Dialogue: 2,0:06:23.90,0:06:25.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,No way
Dialogue: 1,0:06:26.75,0:06:29.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,这射的太牛逼的
Dialogue: 2,0:06:26.75,0:06:29.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's a cool shot right there. it is
Dialogue: 1,0:06:45.80,0:06:51.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,-老铁这效果不错啊 -简直了都
Dialogue: 2,0:06:45.80,0:06:51.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,-Dude this is uh, this is respectable -This is legit
Dialogue: 1,0:06:51.02,0:06:54.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,在看了更多的高速镜头后我们发现了一些有趣的事情
Dialogue: 2,0:06:51.02,0:06:54.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,After reviewing more of the high-speed footage, we noticed something interesting
Dialogue: 1,0:06:56.55,0:07:00.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,哈哈哈这应该配个来回摇摆的音效
Dialogue: 2,0:06:56.55,0:07:00.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,The sound effect there is like "doy yoy yoy"
Dialogue: 1,0:07:01.62,0:07:04.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是Destin找到的一个非常有趣的技术发现
Dialogue: 2,0:07:01.62,0:07:04.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was an interesting technical observation from Destin
Dialogue: 1,0:07:04.22,0:07:08.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,而白色立柱过于柔软也让我们打出了一些很糟糕的几杆，比如这样
Dialogue: 2,0:07:04.22,0:07:08.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that tee flexibility was causing us to hit some bad shots like this
Dialogue: 1,0:07:08.76,0:07:11.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,最显然的解决办法就是让白色立柱更结实一点
Dialogue: 2,0:07:08.76,0:07:11.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,The obvious fix is just to make the tee more rigid
Dialogue: 1,0:07:11.72,0:07:14.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样它弹出的时候就不会乱晃
Dialogue: 2,0:07:11.72,0:07:14.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that it doesn't over rotate when it pops up
Dialogue: 1,0:07:14.27,0:07:16.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这有一个问题
Dialogue: 2,0:07:14.27,0:07:16.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there's a problem with this
Dialogue: 1,0:07:16.30,0:07:18.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,都说力会沿着刚性物体传递
Dialogue: 2,0:07:16.30,0:07:18.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's a saying that force follows stiffness
Dialogue: 1,0:07:18.35,0:07:21.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,而对于我们来说白色立柱太结实的话会把大量的力传递过去
Dialogue: 2,0:07:18.35,0:07:21.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,and for us a really stiff tee would transfer a bunch of force
Dialogue: 1,0:07:21.40,0:07:23.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,并摧毁我们3D打印的弹出机构
Dialogue: 2,0:07:21.40,0:07:23.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and destroy our nice 3d printed pop-up mechanism
Dialogue: 1,0:07:23.93,0:07:28.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,想象我手里这坨搓成条的纸就是那个白色立柱，它显然很软
Dialogue: 2,0:07:23.93,0:07:28.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now imagine this crumpled up piece of paper is the tee which is obviously way less stiff
Dialogue: 1,0:07:28.57,0:07:31.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们用软橡胶制成的白色立柱优势在于它会像这坨纸一样
Dialogue: 2,0:07:28.57,0:07:31.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,Our flexible rubber tee was great because it acted like this piece of paper
Dialogue: 1,0:07:31.92,0:07:36.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论你多用力打它它都不会传递到下面损伤我们的设备
Dialogue: 2,0:07:31.92,0:07:36.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,no matter how hard you hit it the force doesn't get translated down and damage our hardware
Dialogue: 1,0:07:36.07,0:07:41.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是Ken想到一个更好的主意，把一根绳系在白色立柱末端，另一端钉在地上
Dialogue: 2,0:07:36.07,0:07:41.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Ken had the brilliant idea of just tying a string to the tee and staking it into the ground
Dialogue: 1,0:07:41.07,0:07:46.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,这能防止立柱转动过头，同时绳子在拉紧的时候仍能保持立柱是柔软的
Dialogue: 2,0:07:41.07,0:07:46.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,This stopped the over-rotation but everything was still just as flexible when the string pulls tight
Dialogue: 1,0:07:46.70,0:07:49.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,球能顺利击出是不是因为它没有过度摇晃啊？
Dialogue: 2,0:07:46.70,0:07:49.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,does it make the ball fly off because it's it doesn't doink enough?
Dialogue: 1,0:07:49.80,0:07:51.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,想证实这点就要做摇晃测试了
Dialogue: 2,0:07:49.80,0:07:51.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh, the only way to test is the doink test
Dialogue: 1,0:07:54.15,0:07:55.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,啊漂亮~的确有一点摇晃
Dialogue: 2,0:07:54.15,0:07:55.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah, beautiful there was some doinkage
Dialogue: 1,0:07:56.12,0:07:58.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这真是个很聪明、很简单改进措施
Dialogue: 2,0:07:56.12,0:07:58.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just thought this was a really simple clever idea
Dialogue: 1,0:07:58.82,0:08:02.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,一次解决了两个问题，而且非常有效
Dialogue: 2,0:07:58.82,0:08:02.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,that solved both problems at once and as you can see it worked perfectly
Dialogue: 1,0:08:11.46,0:08:14.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在准备上双发F型固推
Dialogue: 2,0:08:11.46,0:08:14.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we are ready to try a dual F motor
Dialogue: 1,0:08:14.35,0:08:17.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,推力是之前折断杆头的E型的两倍
Dialogue: 2,0:08:14.35,0:08:17.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these deliver about twice as much force to the club
Dialogue: 1,0:08:17.62,0:08:19.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,推力是之前折断杆头的E型的两倍
Dialogue: 2,0:08:17.62,0:08:19.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the e motors that made the head snap off

Dialogue: 2,0:09:24.35,0:09:27.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,There we go, this thing was like sub-orbital dude
Dialogue: 1,0:09:27.52,0:09:30.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,-我们有三个U型卡扣，但只用了俩 -对
Dialogue: 2,0:09:27.52,0:09:30.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,-So we have three u-bolts and we only used two -Yeah
Dialogue: 1,0:09:30.70,0:09:34.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这玩意超出了两个U型卡扣的极限，把它们弄坏了
Dialogue: 2,0:09:30.70,0:09:34.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I think we'll just max out those and just crank them way down
Dialogue: 1,0:09:34.10,0:09:35.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们知道这个故障点了
Dialogue: 2,0:09:34.10,0:09:35.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,now that we know this is a failure point
Dialogue: 1,0:09:35.77,0:09:38.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,“所以我们知道这个故障点了”？
Dialogue: 2,0:09:35.77,0:09:38.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now that we know this is a failure point
Dialogue: 1,0:09:38.57,0:09:42.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这话我听说你八百遍了，每次你都等发生以后才有解决办法
Dialogue: 2,0:09:38.57,0:09:42.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's several failure points and I hear you say, oh we have a solution for that
Dialogue: 1,0:09:42.47,0:09:44.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,工程设计就是这样的嘛！
Dialogue: 2,0:09:42.47,0:09:44.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the engineering design process!!
Dialogue: 1,0:09:46.02,0:09:46.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,太有意思了
Dialogue: 2,0:09:46.02,0:09:46.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rather fun
Dialogue: 1,0:09:46.95,0:09:51.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我之前说了，球杆飞出去是因为切太短了，只用了两个U型卡扣固定
Dialogue: 2,0:09:46.95,0:09:51.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like I mentioned the club that failed was cut too short and was only attached using two u-bolts
Dialogue: 1,0:09:51.02,0:09:54.87,辉中,,900,0,0,,我们本以为强度足够提供800磅的向心力

Dialogue: 1,0:09:54.87,0:09:58.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们的确注意到多次点火测试后橡胶手柄会磨损
Dialogue: 2,0:09:54.87,0:09:58.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,We did notice the rubber handle was worn due to so many test fires
Dialogue: 1,0:09:58.22,0:10:01.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这可能就是本次事故的导火索
Dialogue: 2,0:09:58.22,0:10:01.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,which probably initiated the stress concentration leading to the failure
Dialogue: 1,0:10:01.57,0:10:03.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以接下来的改进就是把球杆改长一点
Dialogue: 2,0:10:01.57,0:10:03.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,So our fix was to cut the next club longer
Dialogue: 1,0:10:03.97,0:10:08.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样我们能拧上三个U型卡扣，并且换上全新的橡胶手柄
Dialogue: 2,0:10:03.97,0:10:08.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we could use three u-bolts and really crank them down on a fresh rubber handle
Dialogue: 1,0:10:08.52,0:10:10.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样有了之前六条经验教训
Dialogue: 2,0:10:08.52,0:10:10.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so with all six of our learnings
Dialogue: 1,0:10:10.45,0:10:14.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在我们重新尝试最牛逼的双F型固推
