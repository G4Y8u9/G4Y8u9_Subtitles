Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.11,0:04:08.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,As mentioned before this makes it a pusher system
Dialogue: 1,0:04:08.71,0:04:12.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为逃逸时尾气从飞船底部喷出
Dialogue: 2,0:04:08.71,0:04:12.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,since the exhaust comes out of the bottom of the vehicle when used during an abort.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:12.36,0:04:16.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个系统有趣的一点是它使用的时候看上去很不稳定

Dialogue: 1,0:11:53.38,0:11:55.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后他们把这个装置放到逃逸塔顶端
Dialogue: 2,0:11:53.38,0:11:55.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,They then stick this unit really high up on the abort tower
Dialogue: 1,0:11:55.97,0:11:58.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而提供最大的转向力矩

Dialogue: 2,0:12:02.88,0:12:05.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,In a pusher system there's no tower to provide leverage
Dialogue: 1,0:12:05.70,0:12:08.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以顶上就没地方放控制单元
Dialogue: 2,0:12:05.70,0:12:08.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can't put control services up there.
Dialogue: 1,0:12:08.39,0:12:13.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以使用无法控制推力大小的固体火箭发动机就不太合适
Dialogue: 2,0:12:08.39,0:12:13.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,So using a solid rocket motor that can't provide thrust differential can be a bit of a no-no.
Dialogue: 1,0:12:13.24,0:12:18.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这两艘飞船无法使用固体逃逸发动机还有第二个原因
