Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.94,0:03:01.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果温度太高 可能意味着它相比其他刹车部分运转太剧烈
Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.94,0:03:01.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,if they're too hot, that could mean they're engaging too much, in comparison to the other brakes.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:01.56,0:03:06.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是这个重量上的限制导致了大家的卡车大多成了现在的样子：
Dialogue: 2,0:03:01.56,0:03:06.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the weight issue, though, is why the average rig looks just like this -

Dialogue: 2,0:03:10.75,0:03:16.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,The trade-off means that larger, extended sleepers are only common with, for example, long-haul moving trucks,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.77,0:03:22.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种卡车运输货物重量不大 很少会有限重的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:03:16.77,0:03:22.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,which, due to the low weight and density of the carried goods, rarely have an issue with weight limits.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:22.73,0:03:27.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以鉴于多数卡车这种只能勉强满足舒适的造型
Dialogue: 2,0:03:22.73,0:03:27.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, given that most trucks look like this, with just the bare bones of comforts,
