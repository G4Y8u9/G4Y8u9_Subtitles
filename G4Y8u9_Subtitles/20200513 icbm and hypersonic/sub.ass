Dialogue: 2,0:04:04.40,0:04:06.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,but then they descend to the top of the atmosphere
Dialogue: 1,0:04:07.04,0:04:10.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,利用飞行器的机体产生的冲击波
Dialogue: 2,0:04:07.04,0:04:10.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,and use the shockwave created the body of the craft

Dialogue: 2,0:04:10.30,0:04:14.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,in a phenomenon called compression lift to skim across it,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:14.81,0:04:20.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后当它接近目标时下降 像一个可操纵的高超音速滑翔机一样
Dialogue: 2,0:04:14.81,0:04:20.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,then as it nears its target it drops down and acts like a steerable hypersonic glider
Dialogue: 1,0:04:20.66,0:04:25.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,这使得反导防御系统更难瞄准
Dialogue: 2,0:04:20.66,0:04:25.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes it much more difficult to target by anti-missile defence systems.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:25.89,0:04:30.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,高超音速巡航导弹也可以用火箭或飞机发射
Dialogue: 2,0:04:25.89,0:04:30.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hypersonic cruise missiles can also be launched on a rocket or from a plane
Dialogue: 1,0:04:30.54,0:04:36.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,但它们并不进入太空 而是像普通巡航导弹那样在大气层内飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:04:30.54,0:04:36.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,but instead of going into space, they fly through the atmosphere like a normal cruise missile.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:36.54,0:04:38.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,不同之处在于它们的速度
Dialogue: 2,0:04:36.54,0:04:38.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,The difference is in their speed,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:38.45,0:04:42.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们没有像战斧巡航导弹那样使用传统的喷气式发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.45,0:04:42.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of using a conventional jet engine like in the Tomahawk cruise missile,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:42.81,0:04:47.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是使用超音速燃烧冲压发动机(SCRAMjet)以4马赫以上的速度飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:04:42.81,0:04:47.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,they use a SCRAMjet engine which only works above MACH 4
Dialogue: 1,0:04:47.72,0:04:53.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以最初必须用火箭提升到这个速度 然后让SCRAMjet接管
Dialogue: 2,0:04:47.72,0:04:53.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they have to initially boosted to that speed by a rocket, then the SCRAMjet takes over.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:53.78,0:04:57.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是高超音速导弹的优势所在
Dialogue: 2,0:04:53.78,0:04:57.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is where hypersonic missiles have the upper hand
Dialogue: 1,0:04:57.21,0:05:02.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为它们可以使用飞行高度更低的低空弹道
Dialogue: 2,0:04:57.21,0:05:02.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they can use what is known as depressed trajectory to fly much lower
Dialogue: 1,0:05:02.27,0:05:06.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对于滑翔导弹 它仍可以进行最高25马赫的高超音速飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:05:02.27,0:05:06.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,but still at hypersonic speeds of upto MACH 25 for the gliders,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:06.24,0:05:10.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样它们可以在被发现之前就能接近目标
Dialogue: 2,0:05:06.24,0:05:10.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they can get closer to the target before being detected.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:10.80,0:05:15.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不仅给对手留下了极少的时间来确定其飞行路线
Dialogue: 2,0:05:10.80,0:05:15.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,This not only leaves very little time for the opponent to figure out their course,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:15.23,0:05:18.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们还可以在现有的ABM系统下飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:05:15.23,0:05:18.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,they can also fly under existing ABM systems
Dialogue: 1,0:05:18.98,0:05:27.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为ABM系统设计是寻找并拦截从太空中高空飞来的ICBM并预测其轨迹
Dialogue: 2,0:05:18.98,0:05:27.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,which are designed to look for and intercept ICBM's coming in high from space and on a predictable trajectory.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:27.92,0:05:33.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们的高超音速性质使它们在低空几乎不可能被击落
Dialogue: 2,0:05:27.92,0:05:33.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,Their hypersonic speed makes them almost impossible to shoot down at low altitude
Dialogue: 1,0:05:33.14,0:05:37.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,并且有机动能力 使其飞行轨迹无法预测
Dialogue: 2,0:05:33.14,0:05:37.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they can manoeuvre so their course can't be predicted.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:37.52,0:05:43.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,高超音速巡航导弹也被吹捧为威力巨大的反舰导弹
Dialogue: 2,0:05:37.52,0:05:43.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hypersonic cruise missiles have also be touted as extremely potent anti-ship missiles
Dialogue: 1,0:05:43.25,0:05:50.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为即使没有弹头 以5马赫或更快的速度击中航母也会造成大破
Dialogue: 2,0:05:43.25,0:05:50.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,because even without a warhead, hitting an aircraft carrier at MACH 5 or above would cause a lot of damage,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:50.85,0:05:55.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能不会击沉 但很可能使其失去战斗能力
Dialogue: 2,0:05:50.85,0:05:55.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,it may not sink the ship but it would more than likely put it out of action.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:55.58,0:06:01.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,但高超音速导弹有一个问题 它影响了所有正在发展高超音速导弹的国家
Dialogue: 2,0:05:55.58,0:06:01.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there is a problem with hypersonic missiles which is affecting all the countries who are developing them
Dialogue: 1,0:06:01.45,0:06:06.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这个问题是由高超音速导弹的优势所造成的——它的速度
Dialogue: 2,0:06:01.45,0:06:06.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and its caused by the very thing that gives them their advantage, namely their speed.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:07.02,0:06:14.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,在大气层中以高超音速飞行会产生大量的热量 且会随着速度的增加而增加
Dialogue: 2,0:06:07.02,0:06:14.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Flying at hypersonic speeds in the atmosphere creates a tremendous amount of heat which increases with speed.
