Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.22,0:03:18.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后在燃料罐一端放一个阀门
Dialogue: 2,0:03:16.22,0:03:18.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,then put a valve on one end of the tank
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.15,0:03:22.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,再放一个喷嘴来让燃料加速从而产生推力
Dialogue: 2,0:03:18.15,0:03:22.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,and a propelling nozzle that accelerates the propellant into workable thrust.

Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.70,0:03:38.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,You'll often find these used in reaction control systems
Dialogue: 1,0:03:38.26,0:03:41.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为它们简单、可靠、反应迅速
Dialogue: 2,0:03:38.26,0:03:41.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they're simple, reliable, and they react quickly.

Dialogue: 2,0:07:18.32,0:07:21.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you might hear the turbo pump assembly called the power pack
Dialogue: 1,0:07:21.67,0:07:24.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为它真的就是给发动机提供动力的东西
Dialogue: 2,0:07:21.67,0:07:24.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it really is what powers the engine.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:24.30,0:07:28.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,在开式循环中,预燃室中燃烧过的燃料会直接排出
Dialogue: 2,0:07:24.30,0:07:28.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the open cycle system, the spent propellant from the preburner is simply dumped overboard

Dialogue: 2,0:07:28.67,0:07:31.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,and does not contribute any significant thrust.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:31.25,0:07:37.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,这使得开式循环效率更低,因为驱动泵所使用的燃料和氧化剂基本全浪费了
Dialogue: 2,0:07:31.25,0:07:37.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,This makes it less efficient since the fuel and oxidizer used to spin the pumps is basically wasted.

Dialogue: 2,0:07:41.95,0:07:44.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,that makes it pretty difficult to start up
Dialogue: 1,0:07:44.05,0:07:50.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为驱动涡轮泵的预燃室需要高压燃料和氧化剂才能运行
Dialogue: 2,0:07:44.05,0:07:50.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,since the preburner that powers the turbo pump needs high pressure fuel and oxidizer to operate.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:50.77,0:07:57.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以预燃室需要涡轮泵转动才能让自己有完全可运行的压力状态
Dialogue: 2,0:07:50.77,0:07:57.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the preburner requires the turbo pumps to spin before it can get up to full operational pressure itself
Dialogue: 1,0:07:57.24,0:08:01.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,但涡轮泵又需要预燃室点火才能驱动自己
Dialogue: 2,0:07:57.24,0:08:01.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the turbo pumps need the preburner to fire in order to spin the turbo pumps.

Dialogue: 1,0:08:15.95,0:08:19.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,记得压力总会从高处流向低处吧
Dialogue: 2,0:08:15.95,0:08:19.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember pressure always flows from high to low
Dialogue: 1,0:08:19.37,0:08:23.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以涡轮泵压力要比燃烧室压力高
Dialogue: 2,0:08:19.37,0:08:23.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the turbo pumps need to be a higher pressure than the chamber pressure.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:23.12,0:08:29.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味着进入预燃室的管道是整个火箭发动机里压力最高的地方
Dialogue: 2,0:08:23.12,0:08:25.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this means the inlets leading to the preburner
Dialogue: 2,0:08:25.90,0:08:29.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,is actually the highest pressure point in the entire rocket engine.

Dialogue: 2,0:14:06.57,0:14:07.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what they did.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:07.90,0:14:11.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,但使用两根独立的轴又带来了新问题
Dialogue: 2,0:14:07.90,0:14:11.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,But having two separate shafts created another new problem.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:11.12,0:14:15.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,工程师把高温高压的氢气
Dialogue: 2,0:14:11.12,0:14:15.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now engineers were putting high pressure hot gaseous hydrogen

Dialogue: 2,0:14:15.07,0:14:19.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the same shaft right next door to the liquid oxygen pump.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:19.57,0:14:22.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,一旦那一部分氢气从预燃室泄漏(到液氧泵)

Dialogue: 2,0:14:22.80,0:14:27.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,it would start a fire in the LOX pump which is catastrophically bad.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:27.70,0:14:34.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,氢又非常难储存,因为它密度太低,太轻了
Dialogue: 2,0:14:27.70,0:14:34.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hydrogen is also very hard to contain because it's so not dense, un-dense, lightweight

Dialogue: 2,0:14:34.95,0:14:37.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,it likes to sneak through cracks and get out anywhere it can.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:37.90,0:14:42.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以工程师们不得不设计一个复杂的密封装置放置氢泄漏
Dialogue: 2,0:14:37.90,0:14:42.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,So engineers had to make an elaborate seal to keep the hot hydrogen from sneaking out.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:42.37,0:14:45.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种密封方法叫吹气密封
Dialogue: 2,0:14:42.37,0:14:45.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,The seal required for this is called a purge seal
Dialogue: 1,0:14:45.07,0:14:49.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际中是用氦气加压的,使其成为压力最高的地方
Dialogue: 2,0:14:45.07,0:14:49.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's actually pressurized by helium so that it's the highest point of pressure.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:49.60,0:14:52.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使密封泄漏,流出来的也是惰性的氦气
Dialogue: 2,0:14:49.60,0:14:52.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the seal leaks it just leaks inert helium.
Dialogue: 1,0:14:53.27,0:14:54.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,很精巧的方法,但要注意
Dialogue: 2,0:14:53.27,0:14:54.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's genius but take a look at

Dialogue: 2,0:15:18.10,0:15:20.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,here's a simplified diagram of that.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:20.12,0:15:22.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,我没费劲地把两个泵画成不一样的大小
Dialogue: 2,0:15:20.12,0:15:22.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I didn't bother making the fuel pumps different sizes
Dialogue: 1,0:15:22.90,0:15:27.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,我只想让大家关注流向,让其变得尽可能简单
Dialogue: 2,0:15:22.90,0:15:27.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I just want to focus on the flow here and help make that as simple as possible.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:27.40,0:15:32.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,但请记住,RS-25发动机以富燃方式运转的两个预燃室
Dialogue: 2,0:15:27.40,0:15:32.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,But do note both preburners of the RS-25 run fuel rich
Dialogue: 1,0:15:32.34,0:15:36.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然看起来一样,但驱动的是不同的两个泵
Dialogue: 2,0:15:32.34,0:15:36.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,so although they might look the same they power different pumps
Dialogue: 1,0:15:36.67,0:15:40.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,我会把动画再在这放几秒,让你们多理解一下
Dialogue: 2,0:15:36.67,0:15:40.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'll just let this run here for a few seconds so you can study it for a bit
Dialogue: 1,0:15:40.37,0:15:44.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,也不要担心,我还会在讲完所有循环种类后把所有的图放一起
Dialogue: 2,0:15:40.37,0:15:44.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,but don't worry we'll also put all these up on screen at the same time once we cover them all.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:44.95,0:15:50.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,闭式循环提升了发动机的整体性能,有很大的优势
Dialogue: 2,0:15:44.95,0:15:50.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the closed cycle improves the overall performance of the engine and is highly advantageous.
Dialogue: 1,0:15:50.36,0:15:52.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,那还能有哪些改进呢?
Dialogue: 2,0:15:50.36,0:15:52.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how can it get any better than this?
Dialogue: 1,0:15:52.92,0:15:57.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们终于可以开始讲全流量分级燃烧循环了
Dialogue: 2,0:15:52.92,0:15:57.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're finally ready to talk about the full flow staged combustion cycle
Dialogue: 1,0:15:57.07,0:16:00.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,基本上是组合了刚讲过的上述两种循环方式
Dialogue: 2,0:15:57.07,0:16:00.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,which basically just combines the two cycle methods we just talked about.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:00.72,0:16:02.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,在FFSCC中
Dialogue: 2,0:16:00.72,0:16:02.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,With the full flow staged combustion cycle,
Dialogue: 1,0:16:02.67,0:16:07.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会用两个预燃室,一个富燃运行,一个富氧运行
Dialogue: 2,0:16:02.67,0:16:07.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,you take two preburners one that runs fuel rich and one that runs oxygen rich.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:07.67,0:16:13.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,富燃预燃室驱动燃料泵,富氧预燃室驱动液氧泵
Dialogue: 2,0:16:07.67,0:16:13.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,The fuel rich preburner powers the fuel pump and the oxygen rich preburner powers the LOX pump.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:13.55,0:16:18.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味着FFSCC需要克服富氧情况下的困难
Dialogue: 2,0:16:13.55,0:16:18.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,This means the full flow staged combustion cycle needs to tackle the oxygen rich problems
Dialogue: 1,0:16:18.50,0:16:23.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,前文已提过,需要研发出特种合金来克服
Dialogue: 2,0:16:18.50,0:16:23.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,which again is solved by developing very strong metal alloys.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:23.30,0:16:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以太空叉在自家工厂研发出了名为"SX500"的特种合金
Dialogue: 2,0:16:23.30,0:16:28.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,So SpaceX developed their own super alloys in house that they named SX500.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:28.35,0:16:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,根据马一龙所述,SX500可以承受800bar(80MPa)的高温富氧燃气
Dialogue: 2,0:16:28.35,0:16:33.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,According to Elon Musk it's capable of over 800 bar of hot oxygen rich gas.

Dialogue: 2,0:16:33.87,0:16:37.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,That may have been one of the biggest hurdles in developing the Raptor engine.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:37.52,0:16:40.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,幸运的是,富燃的预燃室只驱动燃料泵
Dialogue: 2,0:16:37.52,0:16:40.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,Luckily the fuel rich side only pumps fuel
Dialogue: 1,0:16:40.27,0:16:43.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以如果高温(富燃)燃气从泵轴处泄漏
Dialogue: 2,0:16:40.27,0:16:43.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if some of that hot fuel leaks through the seal on the shaft
Dialogue: 1,0:16:43.60,0:16:47.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,它也只会遇到更多的燃料,没啥大事
Dialogue: 2,0:16:43.60,0:16:47.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,it just comes in contact with more fuel which is kind of no big deal.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:47.85,0:16:50.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以不需要那些非常非常精细的密封装置
Dialogue: 2,0:16:47.85,0:16:50.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,So no need for one of those really really elaborate seals.
Dialogue: 1,0:16:51.07,0:16:56.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,FFSCC不太可能用煤油作燃料,因为富燃预燃室会有结焦的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:16:51.07,0:16:56.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Full flow likely wouldn't work with RP-1 due to the coking problems with a fuel rich preburner
Dialogue: 1,0:16:56.25,0:16:59.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,而其他燃料仍可以使用这种设计

Dialogue: 2,0:17:00.70,0:17:02.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,The advantage of the system is that
Dialogue: 1,0:17:02.12,0:17:06.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃料和氧化剂在到达主燃烧室的时候都是气态
Dialogue: 2,0:17:02.12,0:17:06.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,since both the fuel and the oxidizer arrive in the combustion chamber as a hot gas
Dialogue: 1,0:17:06.97,0:17:10.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们会更加充分的燃烧,可以达到更高的温度
Dialogue: 2,0:17:06.97,0:17:10.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's better combustion and hotter temperatures can be achieved.
Dialogue: 1,0:17:10.17,0:17:14.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,又没有我们之前提到过的种种极端限制
Dialogue: 2,0:17:10.17,0:17:14.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's also less of a need for that crazy ceiling system as we mentioned earlier
Dialogue: 1,0:17:14.30,0:17:18.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,这对于仅几次或者不翻新就能多次重复使用的发动机来说肯定是很有利的
Dialogue: 2,0:17:14.30,0:17:18.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that's definitely a good thing when you plan to reuse your engine over and over

Dialogue: 2,0:17:18.32,0:17:20.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,with little to no refurbishment between flights.
Dialogue: 1,0:17:20.97,0:17:24.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后,因为其本身流量的提高
Dialogue: 2,0:17:20.97,0:17:24.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,And lastly because there's an inherent increase in mass flow
Dialogue: 1,0:17:24.25,0:17:27.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者说燃料会更快地射入预燃室
Dialogue: 2,0:17:24.25,0:17:27.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,or how quickly all the propellant is shooting into the preburner
Dialogue: 1,0:17:27.20,0:17:30.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,涡轮可以以更低的温度、更低的压力工作
Dialogue: 2,0:17:27.20,0:17:30.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,the turbines can run cooler and at lower pressures
Dialogue: 1,0:17:30.52,0:17:35.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为驱动涡轮泵所需的燃料氧化剂混合比大大减小
Dialogue: 2,0:17:30.52,0:17:35.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the ratio of fuel and oxidizer needed to spin the turbo pumps is much lower.
Dialogue: 1,0:17:35.60,0:17:36.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,而你们这样想
Dialogue: 2,0:17:35.60,0:17:36.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,And think of it this way
Dialogue: 1,0:17:36.87,0:17:44.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,在开式循环的预燃室中你只想用尽可能少的燃料和氧化剂,因为它们都浪费了
Dialogue: 2,0:17:36.87,0:17:41.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,in an open cycle you only want to use as little fuel and oxidizer as possible
Dialogue: 2,0:17:41.80,0:17:44.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the preburner since it's all wasted
Dialogue: 1,0:17:44.22,0:17:48.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,而你又想让它越热越好,因为那样才更有效率
Dialogue: 2,0:17:44.22,0:17:48.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you want it to be as hot as withstandable to make it more efficient
Dialogue: 1,0:17:48.25,0:17:53.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在全流量循环中,所有的燃料和所有的氧化剂都会经过预燃室
Dialogue: 2,0:17:48.25,0:17:53.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,but with the full flow cycle all of the fuel and all of the oxidizer goes through the preburners
Dialogue: 1,0:17:53.60,0:17:58.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以驱动涡轮泵需要多少燃料氧化剂你就可以烧多少
Dialogue: 2,0:17:53.60,0:17:58.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can burn just exactly as much propellant as necessary to power the turbo pumps.
Dialogue: 1,0:17:58.70,0:18:05.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,而更(凉)爽的是你两边的预燃室会极度富燃与极度富氧
Dialogue: 2,0:17:58.70,0:18:05.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the cool thing is your fuel to oxidizer ratios will be so crazy fuel rich and crazy oxygen rich
Dialogue: 1,0:18:05.92,0:18:08.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,使得两边涡轮的温度大大降低

Dialogue: 1,0:18:08.60,0:18:11.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,意味着可以大大提升涡轮泵组件的寿命

Dialogue: 1,0:20:07.17,0:20:10.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,可太空叉既没有选择煤油也没选择液氢
Dialogue: 2,0:20:07.17,0:20:10.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well SpaceX didn't opt for either RP-1 or hydrogen.

Dialogue: 2,0:20:15.22,0:20:18.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why did SpaceX choose liquid methane for the Raptor engine?
Dialogue: 1,0:20:18.52,0:20:22.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,甲烷有哪些优于液氢或煤油的特性?
Dialogue: 2,0:20:18.52,0:20:22.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,What are the qualities that make it advantageous over hydrogen or RP-1?
Dialogue: 1,0:20:30.02,0:20:35.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,迄今为止还没有液态甲烷发动机进入轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:20:30.02,0:20:35.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,Today no liquid methane or otherwise known as methylox engine has gone to orbit.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:35.22,0:20:38.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以它有哪些优点值得作为燃料呢?
Dialogue: 2,0:20:35.22,0:20:38.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what qualities does it have that make it desirable?
Dialogue: 1,0:20:38.40,0:20:41.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们把甲烷和煤油、氢作下对比
Dialogue: 2,0:20:38.40,0:20:41.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's take a look at methane compared to RP-1 and hydrogen.

Dialogue: 2,0:20:41.90,0:20:44.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's put methane in between RP-1 and hydrogen.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:44.72,0:20:46.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会很快知道原因
Dialogue: 2,0:20:44.72,0:20:46.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,You'll see why here really quickly.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:46.62,0:20:50.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们先看设计火箭一级时可能是最重要的因素
Dialogue: 2,0:20:46.62,0:20:50.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start off with perhaps the biggest factor when designing your first stage,
Dialogue: 1,0:20:50.87,0:20:52.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃料的密度
Dialogue: 2,0:20:50.87,0:20:52.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,the density of the propellant.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:52.75,0:20:57.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃料密度大,意味着同样质量的燃料,燃料罐可以更小更轻
Dialogue: 2,0:20:52.75,0:20:57.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,Having a denser fuel means that tanks are smaller and lighter for a given mass of fuel.
Dialogue: 1,0:20:58.07,0:21:00.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,更小的燃料罐等于更轻的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:20:58.07,0:21:00.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,A smaller tank equals a lighter rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:21:00.80,0:21:05.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这是三种燃料的密度,单位是克每升
Dialogue: 2,0:21:00.80,0:21:05.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here's the density of these three fuels measured in grams per liter.
Dialogue: 1,0:21:05.00,0:21:10.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是说一升这样的燃料有多重,准确讲是质量是多少
Dialogue: 2,0:21:05.00,0:21:10.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,In other words how much does one liter of this stuff weigh or really what's its mass.
Dialogue: 1,0:21:10.50,0:21:15.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,先是煤油,密度是每升813克
Dialogue: 2,0:21:10.50,0:21:15.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,Starting off with RP-1, one liter is around 813 grams.
Dialogue: 1,0:21:15.77,0:21:21.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,煤油的密度是液氢的10倍,后者只有70克每升
Dialogue: 2,0:21:15.77,0:21:21.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,RP-1 is 11 times more dense than hydrogen which is only 70 grams per liter
Dialogue: 1,0:21:21.42,0:21:25.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,而液态甲烷密度刚好在中间,422克每升
Dialogue: 2,0:21:21.42,0:21:25.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,and methylox is right in the middle at 422 grams per liter.
Dialogue: 1,0:21:25.55,0:21:31.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,记得飞艇曾经是用氢气填充让其比空气轻吗?
Dialogue: 2,0:21:25.55,0:21:31.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember how airships or zeppelins used to be filled with hydrogen to make them lighter than air?
Dialogue: 1,0:21:31.15,0:21:35.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,嗯,这是因为氢气密度比我们大气还要低
Dialogue: 2,0:21:31.15,0:21:35.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, that's because hydrogen is so much less dense in our atmosphere
Dialogue: 1,0:21:35.27,0:21:39.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然易燃,但它还是填充气球的最好选择
Dialogue: 2,0:21:35.27,0:21:39.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,it makes for an excellent albeit really flammable gas for a balloon.
Dialogue: 1,0:21:39.92,0:21:43.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们都听过兴登堡的事故吧?
Dialogue: 2,0:21:39.92,0:21:43.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean we all remember the Hindenburg, right?
Dialogue: 1,0:21:43.52,0:21:48.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,还要注意的是煤油的813克每升是一个平均值
Dialogue: 2,0:21:43.52,0:21:48.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should also be noted that 813 grams per liter is an average for RP-1
Dialogue: 1,0:21:48.57,0:21:55.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,太空叉会为Falcon 9和Falcon Heavy的煤油降温从而提升2-4%的密度
Dialogue: 2,0:21:48.57,0:21:55.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,but SpaceX chills their RP-1 in their Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy for about a 2 to 4% increase in density.
Dialogue: 1,0:21:55.55,0:22:00.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,但历史上煤油的密度差不多就是813克每升
Dialogue: 2,0:21:55.55,0:22:00.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,But historically RP-1's density is right around that 813 grams per liter.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:00.85,0:22:04.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以从密度来讲,甲烷的性能在煤油和液氢的正中间
Dialogue: 2,0:22:00.85,0:22:04.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the case of density methane is kind of right in the middle of the two others
Dialogue: 1,0:22:04.65,0:22:06.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,但除了密度还有很多因素
Dialogue: 2,0:22:04.65,0:22:06.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,but there's more to it than just density.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:06.87,0:22:13.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们还要考虑燃料燃烧量与氧化剂燃烧量的比值
Dialogue: 2,0:22:06.87,0:22:10.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,We also need to take into consideration the ratio of how much fuel is burned
Dialogue: 2,0:22:10.94,0:22:13.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,compared to how much oxidizer is burned.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:13.10,0:22:15.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是氧化剂燃料混合比
Dialogue: 2,0:22:13.10,0:22:15.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the oxidizer to fuel ratio.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:15.47,0:22:19.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里事情就有趣起来了,表格也会小有改变
Dialogue: 2,0:22:15.47,0:22:19.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here's where things get a little more interesting and the tables turn just a little bit.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:20.10,0:22:23.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭工程师们要计算的是燃料的质量
Dialogue: 2,0:22:20.10,0:22:23.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rocket engineers have to take into account the mass of the fuel
Dialogue: 1,0:22:23.12,0:22:25.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及相应的燃料罐的重量
Dialogue: 2,0:22:23.12,0:22:25.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the corresponding weight of the tanks
Dialogue: 1,0:22:25.55,0:22:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他们不会让燃料处在完全理想的燃烧比
Dialogue: 2,0:22:25.55,0:22:29.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they don't actually burn propellant at the perfect stoichiometric combustion ratio.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:29.80,0:22:36.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们找到了一个合适的折中来平衡燃料罐体积、推力和比冲
Dialogue: 2,0:22:29.80,0:22:36.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,They find the perfect happy medium that balances tank size with thrust output and specific impulse.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:36.22,0:22:40.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们来看看工程师要遇到的燃料氧化剂质量比
Dialogue: 2,0:22:36.22,0:22:40.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at the mass ratios for fuel and oxidizer that the engineers have come up with.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:40.31,0:22:46.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于煤油,燃烧1克煤油需要消耗2.7克氧
Dialogue: 2,0:22:40.31,0:22:46.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for these numbers RP-1 is burned at 2.7 grams of oxygen to 1 gram of RP-1.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:46.57,0:22:50.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃烧1克氢需要6克氧
Dialogue: 2,0:22:46.57,0:22:50.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hydrogen burns at 6 grams of oxygen to 1 gram of hydrogen
Dialogue: 1,0:22:50.69,0:22:54.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,燃烧1克甲烷需要3.7克氧
Dialogue: 2,0:22:50.69,0:22:54.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,and methane burns at 3.7 grams of oxygen to 1 gram of methane.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:54.90,0:22:58.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些数字可以稍稍减小之前密度的巨大差异
Dialogue: 2,0:22:54.90,0:22:58.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,These numbers can now help offset a little the massive difference in density.
Dialogue: 1,0:22:58.87,0:23:02.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们把这些可视化来方便大家理解
Dialogue: 2,0:22:58.87,0:23:02.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's visualize this to help make it easier to digest.

Dialogue: 2,0:23:02.15,0:23:05.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Liquid oxygen is 1141 grams per liter.

Dialogue: 2,0:23:05.85,0:23:08.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a little more dense than RP-1.
Dialogue: 1,0:23:08.17,0:23:12.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,而以2.7:1的质量燃烧液氧和煤油
Dialogue: 2,0:23:08.17,0:23:12.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,So burning LOX and RP-1 at a 2.7 to 1 ratio
Dialogue: 1,0:23:12.14,0:23:17.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么每升液氧你需要0.5升多一点的煤油
Dialogue: 2,0:23:12.14,0:23:17.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,for every liter of LOX you'd need a little over half a liter of RP-1.

Dialogue: 2,0:23:17.12,0:23:18.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,Next up let's do hydrogen.

Dialogue: 1,0:23:22.15,0:23:25.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,你或许以为两者燃料罐要差11倍
Dialogue: 2,0:23:22.15,0:23:25.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,you'd think it'd need a tank that's 11 times bigger.

Dialogue: 2,0:23:32.50,0:23:36.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,This means for each liter of LOX you'd need 2.7 liters of hydrogen
Dialogue: 1,0:23:36.57,0:23:41.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么你的液氢罐大概要有煤油罐的五倍大
Dialogue: 2,0:23:36.57,0:23:41.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,so your fuel tank needs to be approximately five times larger compared to RP-1.

Dialogue: 1,0:24:05.62,0:24:10.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,但燃烧1克甲烷消耗3.7克液氧
Dialogue: 2,0:24:05.62,0:24:10.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the burn ratio is 3.7 grams of oxygen to one gram of methane.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:10.92,0:24:15.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以每升液氧需要0.73升的甲烷
Dialogue: 2,0:24:10.92,0:24:15.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need 0.73 liters of methane for every liter of LOX.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:15.70,0:24:17.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说,你的燃料罐需要

Dialogue: 2,0:24:21.42,0:24:24.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,despite RP-1 actually being almost twice as dense
Dialogue: 1,0:24:24.87,0:24:29.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,而对比液氢,后者的燃料罐将是甲烷的3.7倍大
Dialogue: 2,0:24:24.87,0:24:29.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,and compared to hydrogen its fuel tank would be about 3.7 times smaller.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:29.95,0:24:36.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以燃料氧化剂比让甲烷罐的体积比液氢罐更接近煤油罐的体积
Dialogue: 2,0:24:29.95,0:24:35.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the fuel to oxidizer ratio helps make a methane fuel tank a lot closer to an RP-1 tank
Dialogue: 2,0:24:35.25,0:24:36.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,than it is to a hydrogen tank.

Dialogue: 2,0:24:40.67,0:24:43.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is measured in specific impulse or Isp
Dialogue: 1,0:24:43.68,0:24:47.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可以认为它有点像汽车的燃油经济性
Dialogue: 2,0:24:43.68,0:24:47.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you can think of it kind of like a fuel economy of a gas powered car.

Dialogue: 1,0:25:06.06,0:25:11.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,它的比冲就越高,也就能用同样多的燃料做更多的事
Dialogue: 2,0:25:06.06,0:25:11.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,the higher its specific impulse and therefore the more work it can do with the same amount of fuel.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:12.07,0:25:14.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以的确有点像燃油经济性

Dialogue: 1,0:25:14.25,0:25:18.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以比冲越高,干同样的事情燃料消耗就越少
Dialogue: 2,0:25:14.25,0:25:18.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the higher the specific impulse the less fuel it takes to do the same amount of work

Dialogue: 2,0:33:55.45,0:33:58.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,ultimately means less dead weight the rocket needs to lug around.
Dialogue: 1,0:33:58.61,0:34:00.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们从推重比最小的开始说起
Dialogue: 2,0:33:58.61,0:34:00.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's start from the lowest to highest here.

Dialogue: 2,0:34:06.09,0:34:09.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then there is the RD-180 which is 78 to 1.
Dialogue: 1,0:34:09.37,0:34:12.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后是BE-4发动机,大约80:1
Dialogue: 2,0:34:09.37,0:34:12.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we have the BE-4 at around 80 to 1
Dialogue: 1,0:34:12.46,0:34:15.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,别忘了这个数字并不是完全精确的
Dialogue: 2,0:34:12.46,0:34:15.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,but keep in mind we don't actually have a really good number on this.
Dialogue: 1,0:34:15.85,0:34:17.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以应该还有浮动空间
Dialogue: 2,0:34:15.85,0:34:17.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there might be some wiggle room there.

Dialogue: 2,0:34:17.94,0:34:20.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the F-1 is 94 to 1,

Dialogue: 2,0:34:37.01,0:34:40.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,but who cares how powerful an engine is if it's terribly inefficient.
Dialogue: 1,0:34:40.84,0:34:46.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以接下来我们对比它们的比冲,仍然是以秒为单位
Dialogue: 2,0:34:40.84,0:34:46.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,So next up let's check out their specific impulse which again is measured in seconds.
Dialogue: 1,0:34:46.28,0:34:52.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,比冲最低的是F-1发动机,只有263-304秒
Dialogue: 2,0:34:46.28,0:34:52.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,So starting with the least efficient engine which is the F-1 engine at 263 to 304 seconds
Dialogue: 1,0:34:53.13,0:34:57.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后是梅林发动机,比冲是282-311秒
Dialogue: 2,0:34:53.13,0:34:57.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the Merlin engine at 282 to 311 seconds.
Dialogue: 1,0:34:57.78,0:35:02.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后是RD-180发动机,比冲是311-338秒
Dialogue: 2,0:34:57.78,0:35:02.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we get the RD-180 at 311 seconds to 338 seconds
Dialogue: 1,0:35:03.24,0:35:09.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,同一梯队的BE-4发动机比冲大约是310-340秒
Dialogue: 2,0:35:03.24,0:35:09.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,and somewhere in that same ballpark is the BE-4 which is around 310 to 340 seconds.

Dialogue: 1,0:35:16.08,0:35:25.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后比冲最高的是遥遥领先的RS-25发动机,为366-452秒
Dialogue: 2,0:35:16.08,0:35:25.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,and lastly the king here by far is the RS-25 which is 366 to 452 seconds.

Dialogue: 2,0:35:26.18,0:35:27.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Wow.
Dialogue: 1,0:35:27.21,0:35:31.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,而同时影响推力和比冲的因素是(燃烧室)室压
Dialogue: 2,0:35:27.21,0:35:31.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now one of the factors that affect both the thrust and specific impulse is chamber pressure.
Dialogue: 1,0:35:31.89,0:35:35.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,大体上讲就是室压越高推力越大
Dialogue: 2,0:35:31.89,0:35:35.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now generally the higher the chamber pressure the more thrust
Dialogue: 1,0:35:35.38,0:35:38.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,而发动机潜在的效率也就越大
Dialogue: 2,0:35:35.38,0:35:38.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,and potentially more efficient the engine can be
Dialogue: 1,0:35:39.08,0:35:43.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,而推力相同的情况下,更高的室压可以让发动机更小
Dialogue: 2,0:35:39.08,0:35:43.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,so higher chamber pressures let an engine be smaller for a given thrust level
Dialogue: 1,0:35:43.82,0:35:45.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,同样可以提高其推重比
Dialogue: 2,0:35:43.82,0:35:45.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,also improving their thrust to weight ratio.
Dialogue: 1,0:35:45.93,0:35:50.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,这当中室压最小的发动机是F-1,只有70bar(7MPa)
Dialogue: 2,0:35:45.93,0:35:50.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,The baby here is actually the F-1 which only had 70 bar in this chamber pressure.
Dialogue: 1,0:35:50.78,0:35:52.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我现在要提醒你们一句
Dialogue: 2,0:35:50.78,0:35:52.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, I do need to pause here for a second and remind you
Dialogue: 1,0:35:52.96,0:35:56.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使是70bar(7MPa),也相当于70倍大气压强
Dialogue: 2,0:35:52.96,0:35:56.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,that 70 bar is still 70 times the atmospheric pressure
Dialogue: 1,0:35:56.85,0:36:01.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,相当于你在水下700米受到的压力
Dialogue: 2,0:35:56.85,0:36:01.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the same amount of pressure you'd experience at 700 meters underwater.

Dialogue: 2,0:36:02.30,0:36:03.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yikes.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:03.05,0:36:07.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以即使是这当中最低的室压,也是惊人的大
Dialogue: 2,0:36:03.05,0:36:07.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so even the lowest chamber pressure is still mind-bogglingly high.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:07.32,0:36:14.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来是梅林发动机的97bar(9.7MPa),BE-4是大约135bar(13.5MPa)
Dialogue: 2,0:36:07.32,0:36:14.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,So next up is the Merlin engine at 97 bar then the BE-4 will be around 135-ish bar
Dialogue: 1,0:36:14.76,0:36:17.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后是RS-25发动机206bar(20.6MPa)

Dialogue: 1,0:36:17.78,0:36:24.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后是现役发动机中室压最高的RD-180发动机,约257bar(25.7MPa)
Dialogue: 2,0:36:17.78,0:36:24.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the RD-180 which has been considered the king of operational engines at about 257 bar
Dialogue: 1,0:36:24.21,0:36:27.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,它是目前表格中仅次于猛禽发动机的
Dialogue: 2,0:36:24.21,0:36:27.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is until the Raptor engine which is now kind of online
Dialogue: 1,0:36:27.82,0:36:30.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,而后者将是新的室压王者
Dialogue: 2,0:36:27.82,0:36:30.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is considered the new king of chamber pressure
Dialogue: 1,0:36:30.01,0:36:35.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,目前可达到270bar(27MPa),并有希望达到300bar(30MPa)
Dialogue: 2,0:36:30.01,0:36:35.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,at 270 bars currently and they hope to get that thing up to 300 bar.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:35.38,0:36:40.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,而300bar(30MPa)将会是海底三千米的压力
Dialogue: 2,0:36:35.38,0:36:40.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, 300 bar is like being three kilometers deep in the ocean.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:40.56,0:36:41.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,简直难以想象
Dialogue: 2,0:36:40.56,0:36:41.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can't even fathom.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:44.53,0:36:46.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,好了,发动机本身的参数说得差不多了
Dialogue: 2,0:36:44.53,0:36:46.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that's enough of the specs of these engines.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:46.69,0:36:51.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们来看看它们使用时要考虑的事项,首先是预计造价
Dialogue: 2,0:36:46.69,0:36:51.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, let's look at their operational considerations starting with their approximate cost.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:51.09,0:36:53.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,需要重申的是这仍然是很难确定的一个数值
Dialogue: 2,0:36:51.09,0:36:53.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now again this can be kind of hard to nail down,
Dialogue: 1,0:36:53.91,0:36:56.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以表格中将是最低的估计值
Dialogue: 2,0:36:53.91,0:36:56.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,so these are the best estimates that I could come up with.
Dialogue: 1,0:36:56.57,0:37:00.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些数字全都考虑到通货膨胀而换算成了今天的美元

Dialogue: 2,0:37:30.20,0:37:33.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,if they can remove a lot of the complexity that the current engine has.
Dialogue: 1,0:37:33.84,0:37:38.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我觉得200万美元算是个不错的估计值
Dialogue: 2,0:37:33.84,0:37:38.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for now we're gonna say $2 million is a pretty decent ballpark.
