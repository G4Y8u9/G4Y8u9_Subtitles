Dialogue: 2,0:01:42.64,0:01:46.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because the air can take two different paths through a jet engine.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:46.88,0:01:48.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,一部分走内涵道
Dialogue: 2,0:01:46.88,0:01:48.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,Some of the air passes through the center,

Dialogue: 2,0:02:04.44,0:02:09.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the past, engines would typically get most of their thrust from the jet section.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:09.30,0:02:13.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,但工程师发现只要增大风扇体积 让更多空气走外涵道
Dialogue: 2,0:02:09.30,0:02:13.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,But engineers found that by increasing the fan size and bypassing more air,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.68,0:02:19.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,发动机就能用更少的燃料提供更大的推力 从而提升燃油效率
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.68,0:02:19.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,the engines could produce more thrust with less fuel, therefore increasing the efficiency.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:19.67,0:02:26.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,相反的例子就是协和 它用的涡轮喷气发动机中几乎所有推力都来自内涵道
Dialogue: 2,0:02:19.67,0:02:26.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,In contrast, Concorde used turbojet engines which got almost all of their thrust from burning fuel,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:26.07,0:02:29.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致效率远低于现代发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:02:26.07,0:02:29.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,making them much less efficient than modern day engines.

Dialogue: 2,0:03:01.68,0:03:06.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,modern airplanes really separated themselves from Concorde in terms of their emissions.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:06.73,0:03:11.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这些新的大型发动机有一个弱点 并最终影响了飞行时间
Dialogue: 2,0:03:06.73,0:03:11.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,But these new larger engines had one weakness that ended up affecting flight times.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:12.08,0:03:17.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果太多的空气通过这些较大的发动机 风扇基本上会像一堵墙一样
Dialogue: 2,0:03:12.08,0:03:17.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,If too much air passed through these larger engines, the fan would basically act like a wall,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:17.04,0:03:20.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,拖慢飞机速度 从而需要燃烧更多燃料
Dialogue: 2,0:03:17.04,0:03:20.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,slowing the plane down and requiring more jet fuel to be burned.

Dialogue: 2,0:03:21.00,0:03:25.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is why aircraft manufacturers recommend an optimal cruising speed
Dialogue: 1,0:03:25.11,0:03:29.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个速度在880-925公里每小时之间
Dialogue: 2,0:03:25.11,0:03:29.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,between 880 and 925km/h,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:29.28,0:03:31.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,此时发动机效率最高

Dialogue: 1,0:03:31.75,0:03:39.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,什么概念呢？60年代的一个民航客机速度就已接近1000公里每小时了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:31.75,0:03:35.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,To put that into perspective, a typical passenger jet in the 60's
Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.51,0:03:39.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,would fly much closer to 1,000km/h.
