Dialogue: 1,0:07:28.80,0:07:30.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们把所有数据全印出来
Dialogue: 2,0:07:28.80,0:07:30.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we would get this thing printed out,
Dialogue: 1,0:07:30.35,0:07:35.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,每页都全是数字 我们要找的错误数字就藏在这里某个地方

Dialogue: 2,0:08:14.25,0:08:16.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,then it probably bunged up something else.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:16.07,0:08:21.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且如果那个固定值找到了 那它附近的数据应该也没问题
Dialogue: 2,0:08:16.07,0:08:21.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right, and if the fixed value's okay, then somewhere in there our number's probably okay.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:21.74,0:08:23.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,那当你找到那个 有问题的数据

Dialogue: 1,0:08:33.18,0:08:36.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后再回到桌上 拿着那些八进制数
Dialogue: 2,0:08:33.18,0:08:36.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you take it to your desk and take those octal numbers,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:36.78,0:08:38.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,挨个转成十进制数
Dialogue: 2,0:08:36.78,0:08:38.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,convert 'em to decimal numbers,

Dialogue: 1,0:08:42.56,0:08:45.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,算完说这个意思是5摄氏度
Dialogue: 2,0:08:42.56,0:08:45.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Go up my chart and say that means it's five degrees Centigrade.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:46.00,0:08:47.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就写下5摄氏度
Dialogue: 2,0:08:46.00,0:08:47.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you write down five degrees,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:47.53,0:08:48.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后找到你在哪一帧
Dialogue: 2,0:08:47.53,0:08:48.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you figure out what frame you are,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:48.91,0:08:50.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,就能推算出时间
Dialogue: 2,0:08:48.91,0:08:50.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that's about what time it is,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:50.06,0:08:51.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以就是“在某某某时间 得到数据是5摄氏度”
Dialogue: 2,0:08:50.06,0:08:51.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you're, "At this time, I had five degrees."
Dialogue: 1,0:08:51.96,0:08:53.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后你要找下一条数据
Dialogue: 2,0:08:51.96,0:08:53.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you go to the next one.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:53.35,0:08:54.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个活要干上大概两个礼拜

Dialogue: 1,0:08:58.10,0:09:02.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,手工把一个个数据绘制在图表上 然后得出结论
Dialogue: 2,0:08:58.10,0:09:02.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you put all these numbers in and you plot it by hand, and then you say,
