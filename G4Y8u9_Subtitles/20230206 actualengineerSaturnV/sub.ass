Dialogue: 2,0:59:33.57,0:59:38.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I want to talk to those actuators they ain't in the digital world.
Dialogue: 1,0:59:38.27,0:59:41.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这项工作是交给模拟计算机完成的
Dialogue: 2,0:59:38.27,0:59:41.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that was done with the analog computer.
Dialogue: 1,0:59:41.08,0:59:46.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我们通过控制发动机摆动来控制火箭飞行方向这方面
Dialogue: 2,0:59:41.08,0:59:46.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this business of where we're controlling the rocket by moving the engines.

Dialogue: 1,1:00:13.41,1:00:15.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,两者之间是有数据交互的
Dialogue: 2,1:00:13.41,1:00:15.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they're talking to each other,
Dialogue: 1,1:00:15.69,1:00:20.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,但最终发送指令摆动发动机的是模拟计算机的工作
Dialogue: 2,1:00:15.69,1:00:20.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the analog computer ultimately sends the command down to move the engine.
Dialogue: 1,1:00:21.12,1:00:23.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,有意思 所以有一个数字模拟转换的过程
Dialogue: 2,1:00:21.12,1:00:23.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Interesting. So there's a D to A.
Dialogue: 1,1:00:23.57,1:00:26.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,是模拟与数字系统的合作
Dialogue: 2,1:00:23.57,1:00:26.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then... It's a combination of analog and digital.
Dialogue: 1,1:00:26.72,1:00:28.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以您在当中搭建了一座桥梁
Dialogue: 2,1:00:26.72,1:00:28.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you were bridging a gap.
Dialogue: 1,1:00:28.68,1:00:34.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,呃 主要是因为……当时条件如此
Dialogue: 2,1:00:28.68,1:00:34.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, well, that was that was that was what we had at the time.
Dialogue: 1,1:00:34.68,1:00:36.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,后来 航天飞机出来以后
Dialogue: 2,1:00:34.68,1:00:36.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now once shuttle came along, remember, now
Dialogue: 1,1:00:36.78,1:00:41.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,航天飞机有计算机连接各种东西的

Dialogue: 1,1:00:41.67,1:00:45.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以假如你想移动副翼 比如在再入大气的时候
Dialogue: 2,1:00:41.67,1:00:45.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you want to move the ailerons, let's say you're reentering, you want to move the ailerons.
Dialogue: 1,1:00:45.41,1:00:50.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,数字信号会直接下发到那边 那边有一个转换器
Dialogue: 2,1:00:45.41,1:00:50.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, you send that digital signal down and then there's a converter down here
Dialogue: 1,1:00:50.58,1:00:53.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,可以进行转换 变成模拟信号
Dialogue: 2,1:00:50.58,1:00:53.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,that will actually convert it to whatever the analog is to
Dialogue: 1,1:00:54.23,1:00:57.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而控制 比如某某作动器之类的 大致如此
Dialogue: 2,1:00:54.23,1:00:57.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,move the whatever kind of actuator, you know, and so forth.
Dialogue: 1,1:00:57.80,1:01:03.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以纵观历史 你会发现数字计算机在控制流程中越走越远
Dialogue: 2,1:00:57.80,1:01:03.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,So as you go forward, you see that the digital is moving farther and farther down the line.
Dialogue: 1,1:01:03.29,1:01:05.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以您觉得自己是一位先驱吗?

Dialogue: 2,1:35:53.03,1:35:55.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,and sure enough, that semiconductor was shorted out.
Dialogue: 1,1:35:56.03,1:35:58.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们决定用聚亚酰胺膜包上
Dialogue: 2,1:35:56.03,1:35:58.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's why we decided to use this.
Dialogue: 1,1:35:58.14,1:36:05.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,Nate 负责热控的 他想出的把同轴线槽和设备都包上的主意
