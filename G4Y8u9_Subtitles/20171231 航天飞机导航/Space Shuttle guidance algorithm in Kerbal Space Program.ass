Dialogue: 1,0:00:32.85,0:00:35.20,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以这类发射中最重要、最难的部分
Dialogue: 2,0:00:32.85,0:00:35.20,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So the most difficult and important part of such launch

Dialogue: 1,0:01:05.50,0:01:09.20,1080CN,,0,0,0,,最开始程序会计算发射窗口
Dialogue: 2,0:01:05.50,0:01:09.20,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And the first thing that happens is calculation of the launch window.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:09.30,0:01:10.85,1080CN,,0,0,0,,实际上只是粗略估计一下

Dialogue: 1,0:01:14.30,0:01:15.65,1080CN,,0,0,0,,但我们只要粗略估计就行了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:14.30,0:01:15.65,1080EN,,0,0,0,,but we'll make do with that.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:15.70,0:01:18.50,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为整个代码不需要发射窗口的算得有多精确
Dialogue: 2,0:01:15.70,0:01:18.50,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Fortunately the whole system is fairly insensitive to that
Dialogue: 1,0:01:18.55,0:01:21.50,1080CN,,0,0,0,,前后差一两分钟问题不大

Dialogue: 1,0:01:38.10,0:01:40.80,1080CN,,0,0,0,,发射分两个阶段
Dialogue: 2,0:01:38.10,0:01:40.80,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Now, there are usually two phases of ascent to orbit:
Dialogue: 1,0:01:41.00,0:01:44.00,1080CN,,0,0,0,,首先是在大气层内飞
Dialogue: 2,0:01:41.00,0:01:44.00,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and the first one, we're in now - atmospheric ascent.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:44.20,0:01:46.50,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这时候不用多精确
Dialogue: 2,0:01:44.20,0:01:46.50,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And the idea here is not so much about precision
Dialogue: 1,0:01:46.55,0:01:48.90,1080CN,,0,0,0,,飞得稳你就成功了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:46.55,0:01:48.90,1080EN,,0,0,0,,of what we're doing, as is about safety.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:49.00,0:01:51.80,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这时候主要目标是你的火箭完整的飞出大气层
Dialogue: 2,0:01:49.00,0:01:51.80,1080EN,,0,0,0,,We just want to get outside the atmosphere in one piece
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.85,0:01:54.40,1080CN,,0,0,0,,别被风（动压）吹散架了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:51.85,0:01:54.40,1080EN,,0,0,0,,instead of breaking up due to high dynamic loads.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.50,0:01:55.80,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以这里的逻辑
Dialogue: 2,0:01:54.50,0:01:55.80,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So the logic we're following
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.85,0:01:59.40,1080CN,,0,0,0,,就是按照FAR的教程
Dialogue: 2,0:01:55.85,0:01:59.40,1080EN,,0,0,0,,is taken pretty much straight from ferram's Realism Overhaul tutorial,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:59.45,0:02:02.10,1080CN,,0,0,0,,起飞后给个俯仰角，然后
Dialogue: 2,0:01:59.45,0:02:02.10,1080EN,,0,0,0,,so basically pitch over by some known angle
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.15,0:02:05.20,1080CN,,0,0,0,,保持零攻角一直飞
Dialogue: 2,0:02:02.15,0:02:05.20,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and hold attitude prograde at zero angle of attack.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:05.35,0:02:09.05,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当我们飞到大气足够稀的地方，动压小了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:05.35,0:02:09.05,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And once we've gained enough altitude that air density is no longer an issue,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:09.15,0:02:13.40,1080CN,,0,0,0,,就要切换到轨道学的、航天飞机导航算法了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:09.15,0:02:13.40,1080EN,,0,0,0,,then we will switch to orbital ascent using the Space Shuttle algorithm.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.70,0:02:15.30,1080CN,,0,0,0,,如果你们听过PEG
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.70,0:02:15.30,1080EN,,0,0,0,,If you ever heard the word PEG
Dialogue: 1,0:02:15.35,0:02:17.50,1080CN,,0,0,0,,全称叫动力显式制导
Dialogue: 2,0:02:15.35,0:02:17.50,1080EN,,0,0,0,,or Powered Explicit Guidance, then this is exactly it,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:17.55,0:02:18.95,1080CN,,0,0,0,,就酱
Dialogue: 2,0:02:17.55,0:02:18.95,1080EN,,0,0,0,,this is one way of referring to it.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:19.05,0:02:21.40,1080CN,,0,0,0,,还有一点需要知道，绝大多数轨道导航算法
Dialogue: 2,0:02:19.05,0:02:21.40,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Now, the thing about most orbital guidance algorithms,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:21.45,0:02:24.83,1080CN,,0,0,0,,包括航天飞机，是不管大气层里的部分的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:21.45,0:02:24.83,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Shuttle's included, is that they do not take atmosphere into account at all.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:25.40,0:02:26.90,1080CN,,0,0,0,,我说绝大多数因为
Dialogue: 2,0:02:25.40,0:02:26.90,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Although take that with a grain of salt,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:26.95,0:02:29.35,1080CN,,0,0,0,,我真不知道最先进的算法是啥样的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:26.95,0:02:29.35,1080EN,,0,0,0,,as I don't know about the most modern algorithms.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.45,0:02:31.75,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为空气动力学背后的数学
Dialogue: 2,0:02:29.45,0:02:31.75,1080EN,,0,0,0,,This is because maths behind aerodynamics
Dialogue: 1,0:02:31.80,0:02:34.50,1080CN,,0,0,0,,太特么难了，在天上飞的时候根本没法
Dialogue: 2,0:02:31.80,0:02:34.50,1080EN,,0,0,0,,are very complex and back then it couldn't be quickly
Dialogue: 1,0:02:34.55,0:02:36.30,1080CN,,0,0,0,,又快又好的算出来
Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.55,0:02:36.30,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and reliably solved mid-flight. So,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:36.40,0:02:38.20,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以大气层内的阶段，最主要是
Dialogue: 2,0:02:36.40,0:02:38.20,1080EN,,0,0,0,,because in that phase the only thing that matters
Dialogue: 1,0:02:38.25,0:02:39.85,1080CN,,0,0,0,,是省油和精确（我觉得这里是口误，刚还说不用飞太准）
Dialogue: 2,0:02:38.25,0:02:39.85,1080EN,,0,0,0,,is precision and fuel efficiency,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:39.95,0:02:41.95,1080CN,,0,0,0,,我们现在等差不多了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:39.95,0:02:41.95,1080EN,,0,0,0,,we're better off waiting till we're above the air,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.00,0:02:44.50,1080CN,,0,0,0,,可以不管空气动力学了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.00,0:02:44.50,1080EN,,0,0,0,,so we can neglect its effects.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:03.80,0:03:07.80,1080CN,,0,0,0,,固推差不多该烧完了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:03.80,0:03:07.80,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And right about now the SRBs should be flaming out

Dialogue: 1,0:03:15.65,0:03:17.40,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为空气可能还没那么稀薄

Dialogue: 1,0:03:17.45,0:03:20.00,1080CN,,0,0,0,,扔太早不安全
Dialogue: 2,0:03:17.45,0:03:20.00,1080EN,,0,0,0,,if we're too low and the air is too dense, so
Dialogue: 1,0:03:20.05,0:03:22.55,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以我们再飞一会
