Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.62,0:02:39.39,英,,0,0,0,,But that raises the question: how do we control drag?
Dialogue: 1,0:02:39.82,0:02:44.29,中,,0,0,0,,首先为大家介绍"攻角"
Dialogue: 2,0:02:39.82,0:02:44.29,英,,0,0,0,,First, let's start with something called "angle of attack".
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.89,0:02:49.86,中,,0,0,0,,攻角是气流与机翼(翼弦)的夹角
Dialogue: 2,0:02:44.89,0:02:49.86,英,,0,0,0,,Angle of attack is the angle between air flow and a wing.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.11,0:02:54.85,中,,0,0,0,,当然 本例中 气流方向与速度方向刚好相反
Dialogue: 2,0:02:50.11,0:02:54.85,英,,0,0,0,,And of course, in this instance, that airflow is just opposite to our velocity.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.99,0:02:58.39,中,,0,0,0,,因此在本例中 我们可以简单认为 攻角就是机翼与速度方向的夹角
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.99,0:02:58.39,英,,0,0,0,,So a simplification we can make in some cases such as this
Dialogue: 1,0:02:58.39,0:03:03.54,中,,0,0,0,,因此在本例中 我们可以简单认为 攻角就是机翼与速度方向的夹角
Dialogue: 2,0:02:58.39,0:03:03.54,英,,0,0,0,,is to say that angle of attack is the angle between the wing and our velocity.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:04.09,0:03:09.65,中,,0,0,0,,画面中 轨道器的飞行攻角为40度
Dialogue: 2,0:03:04.09,0:03:09.65,英,,0,0,0,,Right now, you can see the Orbiter flying at an angle of attack of 40 degrees.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:10.05,0:03:16.98,中,,0,0,0,,该视角下 我们能注意到阻力是由迎面而来的气流推动轨道器产生的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:10.05,0:03:16.98,英,,0,0,0,,From this perspective, we can see drag is generated by the oncoming airflow pushing on the Orbiter.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:17.09,0:03:19.72,中,,0,0,0,,攻角增大时
Dialogue: 2,0:03:17.09,0:03:19.72,英,,0,0,0,,When the angle of attack is increased,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.72,0:03:24.76,中,,0,0,0,,会有更大的参考面积迎接气流
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.72,0:03:24.76,英,,0,0,0,,a larger forward cross sectional area is presented towards the oncoming airflow.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:24.93,0:03:28.14,中,,0,0,0,,导致轨道器的阻力增加
Dialogue: 2,0:03:24.93,0:03:28.14,英,,0,0,0,,And so the Orbiter experiences more drag.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:28.53,0:03:34.33,中,,0,0,0,,相反 攻角降低时 迎接气流的参考面积降低
Dialogue: 2,0:03:28.53,0:03:34.33,英,,0,0,0,,When the angle of attack is decreased, less cross sectional area is presented to the air flow,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.33,0:03:36.60,中,,0,0,0,,阻力也随之降低
Dialogue: 2,0:03:34.33,0:03:36.60,英,,0,0,0,,and so drag decreases.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.98,0:03:43.98,中,,0,0,0,,同时 攻角不但会影响阻力 还会影响升力
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.98,0:03:43.98,英,,0,0,0,,However, angle of attack doesn't just influence drag, it also influences lift.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:44.25,0:03:49.04,中,,0,0,0,,攻角(从零开始)增加时 升力和阻力都会增加
Dialogue: 2,0:03:44.25,0:03:49.04,英,,0,0,0,,As our angle of attack increases, our lift and drag both increase.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:49.18,0:03:57.32,中,,0,0,0,,但到了某一刻  阻力会继续增加 升力会转而减小
Dialogue: 2,0:03:49.18,0:03:57.32,英,,0,0,0,,While our drag will keep increasing, lift will only increase to a point, then start to decrease.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:57.72,0:04:05.77,中,,0,0,0,,倒也好理解 毕竟完全垂直的机翼不可能产生升力
Dialogue: 2,0:03:57.72,0:04:05.77,英,,0,0,0,,This does make sense, right? You wouldn't expect a wing perpendicular to airflow like this to generate any lift,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:05.77,0:04:09.43,中,,0,0,0,,但阻力却是相当大的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:05.77,0:04:09.43,英,,0,0,0,,but you would expect it to generate a lot of drag.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:10.06,0:04:16.05,中,,0,0,0,,我们可以把升力与阻力组合为"升阻比"
Dialogue: 2,0:04:10.06,0:04:16.05,英,,0,0,0,,We can combine lift and drag together into a lift to drag ratio,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:16.05,0:04:19.37,中,,0,0,0,,并将升阻比与攻角的关系画成曲线
Dialogue: 2,0:04:16.05,0:04:19.37,英,,0,0,0,,and then compare this to angle of attack.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:19.50,0:04:27.21,中表,,0,0,0,,如图 是升阻比与攻角的曲线 即"升阻比曲线"
Dialogue: 2,0:04:19.50,0:04:27.21,英表,,0,0,0,,And so here we have a lift to drag ratio versus angle of attack curve, referred to as a lift curve.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:27.50,0:04:35.31,中表,,0,0,0,,以升阻比曲线的顶点对应的攻角飞行时 飞机的升阻比最大
Dialogue: 2,0:04:27.50,0:04:35.31,英表,,0,0,0,,At the top of the lift curve, we find the critical angle of attack, where we have the highest lift to drag ratio,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:35.31,0:04:42.10,中表,,0,0,0,,攻角小于此时 升阻比正相关于攻角
Dialogue: 2,0:04:35.31,0:04:42.10,英表,,0,0,0,,flying at a lower angle of attack than this, as known as flying on the front side of the lift curve.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:42.10,0:04:47.76,中表,,0,0,0,,而航天飞机在再入段 轨道器会以大于此攻角的姿态飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:04:42.10,0:04:47.76,英表,,0,0,0,,However, during reentry, the Orbiter flies on the back side of the lift curve,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:47.76,0:04:51.34,中表,,0,0,0,,此时升阻比负相关于攻角
Dialogue: 2,0:04:47.76,0:04:51.34,英表,,0,0,0,,having an angle of attack higher than the critical angle.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:51.88,0:04:57.91,中,,0,0,0,,我们现在学会用攻角调节轨道器收到的阻力了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:51.88,0:04:57.91,英,,0,0,0,,We've seen that we can use angle of attack to control how much drag the Orbiter experiences,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:57.91,0:05:01.29,中,,0,0,0,,但这只能用于微调
Dialogue: 2,0:04:57.91,0:05:01.29,英,,0,0,0,,but this is only fine control.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:01.72,0:05:04.04,中,,0,0,0,,在再入段的早期
Dialogue: 2,0:05:01.72,0:05:04.04,英,,0,0,0,,In the early reentry phases,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:04.04,0:05:11.06,中,,0,0,0,,气动热量约束会限制轨道器保持40度左右的攻角
Dialogue: 2,0:05:04.04,0:05:11.06,英,,0,0,0,,aerothermal constraints limit us to stay pretty close to 40 degrees angle of attack.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:11.34,0:05:14.78,中,,0,0,0,,攻角能改变的量只有正负3度左右 称为攻角调节

Dialogue: 1,0:05:14.78,0:05:20.58,中,,0,0,0,,攻角能改变的量只有正负3度左右 称为攻角调节
Dialogue: 2,0:05:14.78,0:05:20.58,英,,0,0,0,,of about plus or minus 3 degrees are called alpha modulation.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:21.04,0:05:27.91,中,,0,0,0,,但攻角调节并不能满足刚刚飞行走廊中的阻力数据
Dialogue: 2,0:05:21.04,0:05:27.91,英,,0,0,0,,But alpha modulation alone is insufficient for achieving the drag profile that we saw earlier.
