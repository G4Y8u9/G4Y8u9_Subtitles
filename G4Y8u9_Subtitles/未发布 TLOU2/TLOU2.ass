Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.09,0:01:17.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,So TLOU2 opens with Joel, discussing the ending events of the first game.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.58,0:01:20.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,The cameras focused on the threat board of the guitar,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.34,0:01:23.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,which has a very distinctive symbol on it, which will be important later.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.91,0:01:27.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,I want you to take a mental picture of this scene
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.25,0:01:30.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it's going to come back all the way at the end of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.60,0:01:33.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,During this conversation between Joel and Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.81,0:01:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel explains his decision to save Ellie over humanity.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.37,0:01:43.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now even this point was one of controversy when the game first launched.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.86,0:01:45.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,You see, at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.42,0:01:50.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,there was a serious question as to whether or not the Fireflies would be able to develop a vaccine at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.91,0:01:55.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,It was one of the reasons that a lot of people thought that Joel's actions were highly justified.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.32,0:01:58.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,Not just in that he was saving Ellie, his "daughter character",
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.89,0:02:02.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,but rather that he didn't want to sacrifice Ellie's life
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.78,0:02:07.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,for the sake of a cause which likely wouldn't find success any ways.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.14,0:02:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, the fireflies in the first game are pretty damn in competent.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.52,0:02:14.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,They hire somebody from outside their ranks to transport,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.67,0:02:19.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,who is likely the most important human being who has ever lived in the form of Ellie
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.29,0:02:24.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,all the way across the country in order to hopefully develop a vaccine.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.21,0:02:28.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,But when you get there and you explore the hospital at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.38,0:02:34.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,you find out that a lot of the doctors involved in this procedure are unsure as to whether or not it's even possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.68,0:02:39.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, literally, every single person in this hospital
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.35,0:02:46.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,is completely inexperienced in developing a vaccine for a fungus such as this.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.29,0:02:49.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the fireflies argument is that at least there's a chance.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.73,0:02:54.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,If Ellie runs off, and they don't even attempt to extract any of the antibodies
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.01,0:02:59.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,or whatever the hell his inside of her brain that allows her to survive after having a bite.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.25,0:03:02.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,Then they will never know whether or not a vaccine is possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.88,0:03:07.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,But if they crack her skull open and try and develop some sort of vaccine at the very least,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.62,0:03:09.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,then there's a chance.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.15,0:03:11.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, in the opening for this sequel,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.97,0:03:14.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,We see that Joel is pretty confident
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.39,0:03:18.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they were trying to develop a vaccine and that they likely would have been able to,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.60,0:03:19.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,but that it would have killed her.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.95,0:03:24.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's Tommy's expression that I think sets the tone
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.44,0:03:27.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,for how the player is supposed to feel about joel's decision.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.87,0:03:33.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,He's stunned, but at the same time he can't really blame Joel for the choice that he made.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.45,0:03:36.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, later on, in this very intro sequence,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.96,0:03:40.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,Tommy turns to Joel and tells him that he would have done the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.56,0:03:46.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, the choice to open the game in this way is very, very important.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.14,0:03:50.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,The writers over at Naughty Dog wanted to remind the player of what Joel had done
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.55,0:03:56.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,and establish that as the fulcrum from which every narrative mechanism will hinge.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.04,0:04:01.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,After this conversation, Tommy still unsure of how to react,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.26,0:04:05.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,simply tells Joel to hop on his horse and head back into town.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.31,0:04:08.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,It buys Tommy some time in order to form an opinion,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.40,0:04:12.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it also gives the player a chance to settle back into this world.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.93,0:04:15.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's really common for sequels to rush into things,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.54,0:04:19.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,Giving the player a chance to see something new and fresh and different
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.05,0:04:21.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they only could have dreamed of in the first game.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.87,0:04:25.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, and thankfully Naughty Dog doesn't do this.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.35,0:04:28.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,They take their time during this intro to set things up,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.29,0:04:30.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I think it works very, very well.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.66,0:04:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,You ride through a beautiful landscape and come up on Jackson,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.87,0:04:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's at this time that we get our first look at a fully realized Jackson,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.37,0:04:42.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,the city that we saw peak of at the end of the first game, but that we could only imagine.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.85,0:04:44.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I've got to hand it to Naughty Dog.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.67,0:04:51.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,This opening sequence has one of the most well realized cities I've ever seen in any video game ever.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.57,0:04:53.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,It truly is fantastic.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.52,0:05:01.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,Every NPC, every animation, every building, every step in the snow is detailed and realistic.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.62,0:05:03.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,As far as immersion is concerned,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.48,0:05:08.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think this is one of the most fantastically effective games that's ever been created.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.60,0:05:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,After you reach the inside of the city,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.53,0:05:16.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,Tommy and Joel hop off of their horses and Tommy offers to stow Joel's horse for him,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.26,0:05:19.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,while also saying that he'll take the truth to his grave.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.35,0:05:21.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,This implies a couple of things.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.06,0:05:24.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,For one, it might seem as though he's referring directly to Ellie
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.20,0:05:28.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,that if Ellie were to find out this truth, it would cause a lot of problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.74,0:05:31.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, as far as Ellie is concerned,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.08,0:05:35.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel simply took Ellie after a bunch of tests were run,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.40,0:05:40.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it was clear that she was not going to be able to provide any sort of help towards a vaccine at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.77,0:05:42.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,At the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.03,0:05:45.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's pretty clear that Ellie sees through this lie, that Joel is telling,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.54,0:05:48.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, she expects that there's more to this story.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.84,0:05:52.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,For the sake of their relationship, she simply goes along with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.14,0:05:54.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, I think there's another implication to this as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.78,0:05:59.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that is that if other people in the camp were to find out what Joel had done,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.19,0:06:01.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,I am not so sure that they would approve of it either.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.62,0:06:06.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, we can talk all day about how incompetent the fireflies were in the first game.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.21,0:06:08.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think there's a real argument to be had there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.31,0:06:11.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean, if I had to entrust them with the fate of humanity,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.46,0:06:14.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,I would hop on the next asteroid off the planet.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.28,0:06:18.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,What I mean, though, is that Naughty Dog is trying to tell his story,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.24,0:06:22.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they're framing the plot points the way that they want you the player to see them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.47,0:06:24.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,For the sake of this story,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.15,0:06:28.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's important to understand that the fireflies were the ones that were trying to save humanity
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.84,0:06:36.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,and were apparently on the cusp of developing a vaccine to save countless millions of lives.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.06,0:06:40.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,And once again, for the sake of this story, that's been told in TLOU2,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.84,0:06:43.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel is the one that undid that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.52,0:06:49.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, at the very least, if Ellie had gone under the knife, there would have been a chance for a vaccine.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.68,0:06:55.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,By killing the doctors that were about to operate on Ellie and potentially develop a vaccine,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.71,0:06:58.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,he effectively saved his "daughter figure",
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.23,0:07:02.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,but he damned all of humanity for the rest of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.67,0:07:06.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,In other words, he strained at a gnat but swallowed a camel.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.39,0:07:11.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,He traded what seemed to be a smaller evil for a much much larger evil,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.31,0:07:17.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,and he did this because his judgment was clouded by his own personal wants and wishes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.10,0:07:23.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,This isn't to say that Joel would or does regret any of this in this particular sequence.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.13,0:07:26.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it is to say that the players should start seriously considering
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.44,0:07:32.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,whether or not Joel's actions were justified, or perhaps even whether or not they were right.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.31,0:07:35.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, Naughty Dog is going to help you think about this
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.12,0:07:41.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,by constantly bringing it up using flashbacks. as Elie grew up in Jackson.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.25,0:07:43.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I promise you before you know it,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.05,0:07:46.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,you might even be convinced that Joel is in fact a villain.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.74,0:07:52.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,This isn't to say that Joel is unlikable character that you should hate him or wish that he were dead,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.65,0:07:56.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,but rather Joel is the one that damned humanity.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.76,0:08:03.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you tell any other story and there's a character which damns humanity for the sake of one single person,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.90,0:08:06.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,we would say he's a bad guy.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.00,0:08:08.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or perhaps we wouldn't even say bad guy,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.64,0:08:13.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,we would simply say that he was a confused or perhaps mistaken individual,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.56,0:08:15.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,whose motivations were complex.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.90,0:08:20.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the point is, it's not as simple as hero and villain.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.94,0:08:23.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,There is a lot of gray in between.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.19,0:08:28.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now this intro sequence is just shortly after Joel's arrival, while Ellie is still young.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.83,0:08:34.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's living out of grandmothers suite in the back of the house that is presumably owned by Joel.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.53,0:08:36.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's super cute that she has her own space,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.60,0:08:41.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,but it even now shows and tells a lot about their relationship.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.90,0:08:46.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now granted, Joel is a middle aged man that found this little girl,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.62,0:08:49.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,and he took her halfway across the country,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.32,0:08:51.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,rescued her from a bunch of cannibals,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.57,0:08:56.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,and now has her in a town that his brother runs with his wife.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.67,0:09:01.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,it could be presumed that her staying in his house could be considered an appropriate.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.71,0:09:03.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I don't think that's the point here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.78,0:09:08.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel is Ellie's "father figure", and I don't think that's a controversial thing to say.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.58,0:09:15.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,The fact that Ellie wants space, physical space separated from him means a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.75,0:09:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, we see Ellie and she's drawing something
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.59,0:09:21.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,that will come back time and time again throughout the rest of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.27,0:09:25.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's actually pretty artsy and gifted, artistically,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.05,0:09:29.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,you'll see this in the note book that you'll be using throughout the course of the main game.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.34,0:09:33.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,She often draws pictures of what she sees or sketches out different things
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.67,0:09:36.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,in order to remind her to return to that area
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.52,0:09:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,or simply to keep a journal of the events and happenings of the main story.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.40,0:09:44.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's listening to music when Joel comes in.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.01,0:09:48.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a really cute and awkward moment, but it's pretty damn sweet.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.99,0:09:52.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,It doesn't take a body language expert to see that there's a lot of tension here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.83,0:09:57.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,Jole's unsure of how to stand, where to move, how to talk, how to relate to her,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.15,0:09:59.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,and Ellie picks up on this as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.64,0:10:01.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,The tension is really palpable.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.71,0:10:05.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,They both know what happened in Utah hasn't been resolved,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.94,0:10:08.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,but neither knows how to broach the topic,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.16,0:10:10.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,so they simply delay it and push it off.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.56,0:10:16.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the point of this sequence is where Joel to express how much he needs Ellie in his life.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.68,0:10:21.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,Let's all just take a moment to relax and appreciate how beautiful the scenery is,

Dialogue: 0,0:13:53.49,0:13:57.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,because that sequence where Dina and Ellie share their first kiss,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.87,0:14:00.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,I thought was a pretty important sequence to see.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.78,0:14:04.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,But Naughty Dog doesn't show it to the player, at least not right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.41,0:14:08.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,Instead, they rely on the dialog to explain what happened,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.28,0:14:10.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I can't help to notice that this is the first instance
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.89,0:14:15.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,where trailers are important to a contextual grasp of the game itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:15.45,0:14:17.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,because, after all, in this case,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.28,0:14:21.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,the scene that's being discussed isn't actually shown to the player
Dialogue: 0,0:14:21.71,0:14:24.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,until the last 15 or so minutes of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:24.79,0:14:32.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,Time and time again, stuff that was shown in the trailers is either changed drastically or is moved around
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.09,0:14:37.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,such that you need to have seen the trailer in order to truly understand what's going on.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:37.99,0:14:42.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I understand that it's a small thing to point out or be frustrated by,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.07,0:14:46.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,because after all chances are every single person who bought the game had seen that trailer.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.80,0:14:51.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, I still think it's strange to show a scene in a trailer,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.06,0:14:54.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,but then not show it in the game when that item is being discussed.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.87,0:14:57.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's one of countless times in this game,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:57.12,0:15:01.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,when Naughty Dog will take a sequence, cut it up into fifteen different parts
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.22,0:15:05.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then spread it randomly, seemingly throughout the course of the story.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.04,0:15:07.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Sometimes I think it helps with pacing
Dialogue: 0,0:15:07.04,0:15:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,by giving the player a break from a very stressful environment or activity,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:11.52,0:15:15.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,but often it feels as though it's jarring and out of nowhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.75,0:15:21.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, we're going to get to some very egregious examples of this later on in the story.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:32.73,0:15:35.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,and everybody wants you to know that it's bigoted.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:35.61,0:15:40.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,You get some sandwiches and then you go off to start on patrol.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:40.11,0:15:43.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's also important to understand that Jesse just broke up with Dina

Dialogue: 0,0:15:48.32,0:15:52.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or may be Dina broke up with him, or maybe it was mutual.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:06.52,0:16:09.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I kind of found this snowball fight to be a little weird
Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.47,0:16:14.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it seemed as though it's meant to serve as some sort of combat introduction.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.37,0:16:19.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I think I was just reading too much into it because I don't think it does a very good job of that.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:19.38,0:16:22.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I did go back through the game a second time,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:22.17,0:16:27.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,as I stated previously on "New Game +" and on the hardest difficulty.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:27.39,0:16:32.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,After becoming completely familiarized with the controls after playing the entire game,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:32.07,0:16:37.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,this whole snowball fight was much more intriguing and interesting and frankly fun
Dialogue: 0,0:16:37.15,0:16:39.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,than it was the first time I played.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:39.12,0:16:43.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,The three tiered stance that Ellie's able to have between standing, crouch and prone
Dialogue: 0,0:16:43.90,0:16:46.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,is something that takes a minute to get used to.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:46.47,0:16:51.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,I know it sounds weird because that's true of pretty much any third person or first person shooter
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.90,0:16:53.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they're going to have those three stances.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:53.85,0:16:59.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,But in TLOU2, there are multiple levels of movement associated with each.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:59.25,0:17:00.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,And that's more of my point.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.48,0:17:05.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,The sequence does a very poor job of introducing the player to those three stances.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.58,0:17:10.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,But you are able to use each of those three stances in this sequence.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:10.32,0:17:11.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,It just seems a little jarring,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.79,0:17:15.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I will admit I appreciate the effort that they put into this
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.56,0:17:18.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it's still way better than the alternative,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.45,0:17:22.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,which would be to have the standard stereotypical sequence
Dialogue: 0,0:17:22.68,0:17:26.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,where the protagonist goes and has shown how to use a gun,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.58,0:17:31.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's like issue bottles or some crabs …  I hate that.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:31.35,0:17:36.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,Probably the most egregious example would be the opening of Fallout 3 when you're given a BB gun,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:36.57,0:17:41.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then you go downstairs, shoot some targets and then some giant radroaches.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:47.58,0:17:50.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,you should at the very least have a little bit of a creative spin to it,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:50.94,0:17:56.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,so I appreciate that throwing compacted snow at children was presented here.

Dialogue: 0,0:18:55.25,0:19:00.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they were going to flip out if you didn't play the whole game as Ellie and or Joel.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.12,0:19:03.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,But a key thing to understand here is that the player must give it time and effort

Dialogue: 0,0:19:06.51,0:19:10.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,in the same way that you can't judge a book by its cover or a film by its trailer.

Dialogue: 0,0:19:26.91,0:19:31.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,And in my opinion, I don't think it's fair to say that playing as any character
Dialogue: 0,0:19:31.44,0:19:37.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,other than the one on the Box-Art is bad bad and means that the game is terrible and not worth your time.

Dialogue: 0,0:25:52.02,0:25:57.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,The fact that Joel is still going on patrols is, in my opinion, a bit of a stretch.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:57.48,0:26:02.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,It would be stupid for him to go on patrols, especially because he has a leadership position within the city.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:02.73,0:26:06.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,His super fancy house, I think, serves as proof positive of that,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:06.96,0:26:11.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,Not to mention that Tommy, his brother, who was also going out on patrols with him,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:11.61,0:26:14.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,has a leadership position within the city.

Dialogue: 0,0:26:17.85,0:26:23.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,So to me, it just seems like a bit of a stretch that Tommy and Joel would be going out on patrols at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:23.22,0:26:28.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I understand that perhaps Joel or Tommy just want to get out and get their hands dirty.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:28.92,0:26:33.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,They don't want to feel old, they don't want to feel as though they can't contribute,

Dialogue: 0,0:26:38.52,0:26:42.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I can't help feel as though Joel and Tommy being out on patrols
Dialogue: 0,0:26:42.16,0:26:46.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,the same patrol routes that Ellie Dina and Jesse are taking,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:46.65,0:26:50.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,was purely designed, and established that way to make sure
Dialogue: 0,0:26:50.98,0:26:57.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,that Abby would be able to encounter Joel and Tommy while she randomly ran through the forest.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:57.60,0:27:01.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this is the reason that I don't like narrative coincidences.

Dialogue: 0,0:27:03.21,0:27:09.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,that the writers are trying to force characters into normally unjustifiable situations.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:09.27,0:27:11.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's not always a bad thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:11.58,0:27:16.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,In fact, in some cases, I think these coincidences can lead to some really interesting sequences.

Dialogue: 0,0:27:48.12,0:27:50.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,But didn't I didn't want to spoil it? So …
Dialogue: 0,0:27:50.76,0:27:53.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is, go watch Breaking Bad, it's awesome.
Dialogue: 0,0:27:53.01,0:27:57.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,The other point is that narrative coincidences can be fine.

Dialogue: 0,0:28:11.34,0:28:17.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's the same reason I hate psychics or prophecies in stories because I think that they're just lazy.

Dialogue: 0,0:28:20.94,0:28:25.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,so they write some sort of prophecy to explain how it's going to happen,

Dialogue: 0,0:28:30.24,0:28:36.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,or if it doesn't seem to be totally justified narratively or in terms of the characters, motivations,
Dialogue: 0,0:28:36.06,0:28:40.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,they simply explain it by way of while he or she was fulfilling the prophecy.

Dialogue: 0,0:31:20.34,0:31:24.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,But apparently this was a seriously considered intro sequence

Dialogue: 0,0:34:10.76,0:34:13.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,is going to be the bread and butter of the game,

Dialogue: 0,0:34:16.05,0:34:20.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,you're going to need to get acclimated to these mechanics as soon as possible.

Dialogue: 0,0:34:27.39,0:34:31.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't really feel the need to explain a lot as to how these sequences work,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:31.86,0:34:36.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,because if you've played the first game, you're going to know how this goes.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:36.00,0:34:39.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's going to be a hot minute before we're thrown anything that's markedly different.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:39.57,0:34:41.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,I will say that in the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:34:41.25,0:34:45.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,it always bugging me that clickers are obviously able to navigate their environments
Dialogue: 0,0:34:45.91,0:34:51.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,by use of clicking sounds that use echolocation to map out their environment.
Dialogue: 0,0:34:51.27,0:34:55.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, they never were able to hear characters talking to each other

Dialogue: 0,0:34:59.88,0:35:06.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,That is mostly true again in this game, except only on the lower levels.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:06.36,0:35:11.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,In my testing, I actually found that on new game Plus on survivor difficulty,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:11.43,0:35:13.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,the clickers can actually hear this as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:13.98,0:35:18.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you open your backpack to swap weapons, they'll notice and they'll come running.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:18.96,0:35:22.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,This was a game changer in terms of immersion.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:22.89,0:35:28.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,Seriously, I've never played a game where I was so attentive to everything that I was doing,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:28.53,0:35:31.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,that I was scared to even open up the inventory,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:31.74,0:35:37.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,because I knew that it was going to create a small amount of sound that could attract clickers,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:37.56,0:35:40.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,which could mean that I die and have to reload.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:40.36,0:35:43.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,Granted to some people, I'm sure that sounds absolutely terrible,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:43.44,0:35:46.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why there are difficulty settings to begin with.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:46.08,0:35:49.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,But if you want to be totally immersed in this game,
Dialogue: 0,0:35:49.47,0:35:52.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,I recommend you play it on the hardest possible difficulty.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:52.92,0:35:54.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,It really does change everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:54.90,0:35:57.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,Another thing to note in this supermarket sequences that
Dialogue: 0,0:35:57.68,0:36:01.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie is wearing a mask when she encounters spores now.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:01.32,0:36:02.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you played the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:02.43,0:36:07.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,this is going to be kind of weird because obviously Ellie is immune to the virus,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:07.41,0:36:10.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,or so we thought, why does she need to wear a mask?
Dialogue: 0,0:36:10.41,0:36:12.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,In the trailers we saw before the game's launch,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:12.66,0:36:16.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,a lot of people thought that this would mean that Ellie was no longer immune,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:16.11,0:36:20.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,or perhaps she was not as immune as she once was,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:20.49,0:36:24.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,so perhaps if she inhaled spores, that would make her very very sick,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:24.06,0:36:25.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,but she would eventually pull through it.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:25.74,0:36:28.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, the explanation is far simpler.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:28.02,0:36:33.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel and Ellie obviously know that Ellie is immune, but nobody else can know that.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:33.69,0:36:35.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,If people were to find out that Ellie's immune,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:35.82,0:36:39.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,the same crap with the fireflies would happen all over again.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:39.72,0:36:43.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now this seems to be much more Joel's wish than it is Ellie's,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:43.71,0:36:51.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,after all, Ellie was totally prepared and fine with giving her life to save humanity in the form of a vaccine,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:51.09,0:36:53.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this would of course make sense because Joel wanted to make sure
Dialogue: 0,0:36:53.84,0:36:58.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,nobody else would come to Ellie to try and capitalize on her gift,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:58.53,0:37:01.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,because if they did, it would mean that he would lose her.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:01.29,0:37:04.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the fact that Ellie is still using the mask, even though she doesn't need to,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:04.98,0:37:08.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think, serves as proof positive that she still cares about what he thinks,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:08.79,0:37:11.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,and she's yet to fully separate and become her own person.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:11.64,0:37:16.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,But this isn't something that's explained or really justified at this point in the game,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:16.14,0:37:22.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,but we will see an actual conversation between Ellie and Joel later on that explains all of this.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:22.32,0:37:27.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,If I throw a bunch of zombies and clickers and eventually find your way up to the top of the supermarket,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:27.33,0:37:29.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,where you jumped down out to the front,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:29.58,0:37:35.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie and Dina's entire goal throughout exploring this supermarket was to clear it of infected,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:35.16,0:37:36.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they've done just that.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:36.33,0:37:40.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,Honestly, it's not a bad way of forcing the player to kill zombies
Dialogue: 0,0:37:40.12,0:37:44.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,in order to get experience with the combat system and become more comfortable with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:44.01,0:37:48.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,A lot of people are going to simply try to stealth around them in most instances,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:48.33,0:37:51.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially later in the game, when resources become very scarce.
Dialogue: 0,0:37:51.45,0:37:58.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,but if the characters mission is to wipe out all infected in an area to protect Jackson, the city,
Dialogue: 0,0:37:58.23,0:38:01.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,you all of a sudden don't have to worry about players doing that
Dialogue: 0,0:38:01.04,0:38:05.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,because they're going to be justified narratively in killing absolutely everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:05.46,0:38:11.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, they can't leave the area unless they've completely wiped all of the infected within that area.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:11.07,0:38:15.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,Once you get out of the supermarket, the blizzard starts to come in full force.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:15.93,0:38:21.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,So Ellie and Dina race through the snow, and end up at a library that Dina knew about.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:21.66,0:38:24.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's the previous abode of somebody named Eugene,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:24.36,0:38:28.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,who, by my calculations, using the log book in the first outpost,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:28.50,0:38:34.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,likely died of a stroke laid in the previous year just a few months before this game starts.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:34.92,0:38:38.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,Well, we know about him is that he was a firefly who served with Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:38.31,0:38:42.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,and he was also an electronics geek who was a total hippy.

Dialogue: 0,0:39:00.15,0:39:07.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,I had to ask the question: Was he actually like selling this stuff? Was he trading it?

Dialogue: 0,0:41:21.81,0:41:28.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,start ripping your hat off and doing all sorts of gross stuff, and then one breaks through,
Dialogue: 0,0:41:28.23,0:41:29.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,and this happens.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:46.44,0:41:48.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now they haven't been introduced yet.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:48.00,0:41:51.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,but as of right now, Abby's just glad to be alive.

Dialogue: 0,0:41:52.92,0:41:55.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel is just some random guy, as is Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,0:41:55.80,0:41:59.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they just happened to be in the right place at the right time to save her.
Dialogue: 0,0:41:59.71,0:42:01.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, a coincidence.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:01.32,0:42:04.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,This one's a little harder to justify and explained.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:04.75,0:42:10.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because they have no reason to be out at this dead end area of a building they have likely been in before.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:10.44,0:42:13.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,All of you escaped together to a ski lodge at the top of the mountain.

Dialogue: 0,0:42:18.96,0:42:23.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,she recommends that they weighed out the storm in a mansion that she and her friends have been staying in.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:23.55,0:42:26.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel and Tommy agree to go without any significant hesitance
Dialogue: 0,0:42:26.98,0:42:29.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,beyond the initial belief that they could survive in the lodge.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:30.05,0:42:32.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,Once again, it's another coincidence.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:32.55,0:42:34.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel and Tommy, aren't this naive,
Dialogue: 0,0:42:34.49,0:42:39.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,or at the very least they shouldn't be, even when pushed in these extreme conditions.
Dialogue: 0,0:42:39.27,0:42:42.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,我的意思是我明白外面暴风雪肆虐\NWhat I mean is, I understand that there's a blizzard raging,

Dialogue: 0,0:42:49.35,0:42:53.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,But Joel and Tommy aren't stupid, and they know not to trust strangers,

Dialogue: 0,0:42:58.44,0:43:03.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they definitely should know that they shouldn't trust a group of strangers

Dialogue: 0,0:43:14.22,0:43:17.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,While it's nice that she's offering to help them in this way,
Dialogue: 0,0:43:17.55,0:43:23.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,it should also raise a lot of red flags that she's willing to help them first of all,
Dialogue: 0,0:43:23.22,0:43:30.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,and also that this giant group of people is present so close to Jackson without their knowledge.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:30.15,0:43:32.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless Joel and Tommy agree to go.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:32.36,0:43:36.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,Once you arrive at the cabin, Joel, Tommy, and Abby dismount and settle into the house.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:36.93,0:43:40.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby is clearly distressed, while Tommy and Joel are none the wiser.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:40.81,0:43:47.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, the dread is building. Something is very wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:47.16,0:43:52.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,Everyone moves into the nearby basement room, And Tommy and Joel introduce themselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:52.01,0:43:56.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, this might be construed as out of character
Dialogue: 0,0:43:56.08,0:43:58.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they would use their real names to a bunch of strangers.
Dialogue: 0,0:43:58.65,0:44:01.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,But in my opinion, it's not actually stretch
Dialogue: 0,0:44:01.29,0:44:06.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,because Tommy and Joel have no reason to believe that their first names could give them away,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:06.03,0:44:09.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,or that one of them is being hunted for that matter.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:09.18,0:44:12.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,Yes, they've all done a lot of really messed up stuff,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:12.18,0:44:17.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,but knowing somebody's first name and hunting them down across the country,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:17.40,0:44:19.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,that seems like a bit of a stretch.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:19.20,0:44:20.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,But here we are.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:20.39,0:44:24.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,Point is I don't think that it's unrealistic that Joel and Tommy use their real names
Dialogue: 0,0:44:24.88,0:44:28.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,when introducing themselves to a group that seemingly is helping them out.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:28.71,0:44:32.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I have to say it's pretty impressive at how slow and steady
Dialogue: 0,0:44:32.52,0:44:38.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,the dread is building throughout this entire introductory sequence, the prologue of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:38.55,0:44:39.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,And then at this very moment,
Dialogue: 0,0:44:39.87,0:44:47.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,when Joel says his name and everybody's faces turn from very friendly to cold and evil.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:47.91,0:44:50.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a moment that I'm not sure I'll ever forget
Dialogue: 0,0:44:50.41,0:44:54.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,the second Joel says his name, the room shifts.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:54.18,0:44:56.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,You could hear a pin drop.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:56.36,0:45:01.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,Instead of being friendly, they all looked at him as though their hyenas looking at their next meal.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:01.53,0:45:07.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's important to note that this kindness that we feel before Joel introduces himself
Dialogue: 0,0:45:07.00,0:45:11.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,is very important and it will come up again later, I promise you.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:11.97,0:45:15.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now Joel picks up on this shift, and this plays out.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:45.63,0:47:48.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,We cut back to Ellie, closing in on the cabin.
Dialogue: 0,0:47:48.06,0:47:52.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now right before Joel and Tommy pushed up to the cabin with Abby,
Dialogue: 0,0:47:52.29,0:48:01.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,We saw Jesse come across Abby and Dina in the basement of Eugene's library in a compromised position.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:01.26,0:48:06.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,He tells them that Joel and Tommy are missing and nobody has seen them since the storm came in.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:06.48,0:48:10.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie becomes panicked and races off to help find them.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:10.35,0:48:13.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's important to note also that Ellie stressed
Dialogue: 0,0:48:13.41,0:48:17.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they should all split up to try and cover as much ground as possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:17.16,0:48:19.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,Some people have said that this itself is a coincidence
Dialogue: 0,0:48:19.72,0:48:22.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,or a bit of a stretch that they wouldn't actually do this,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:22.37,0:48:23.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,but again, think about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:23.94,0:48:26.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,From her perspective, I don't think it's a stretch.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:26.73,0:48:28.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because as far as Ellie is concerned,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:28.56,0:48:33.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's very possible that Joel and Tommy simply had to bunker down somewhere because of the blizzard
Dialogue: 0,0:48:33.80,0:48:36.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,and were caught there by surprise.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:36.27,0:48:42.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's not to say that she expected Joel to be hunted by some random chick from Seattle.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:42.15,0:48:46.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,But regardless everybody breaks off looking for Joel and Tommy.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:46.05,0:48:50.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,After Abby starts her attack on Joel, we cut to Ellie, closing in on the cabin,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:50.37,0:48:54.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,they give a bit of a fake out here by dropping some ammo right as you enter the cabin,
Dialogue: 0,0:48:54.54,0:48:56.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,which makes the player think that you're about to fight.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:56.70,0:48:58.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,I actually really like it.
Dialogue: 0,0:48:58.08,0:49:00.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,When games do this, do this little fake out.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:00.09,0:49:01.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,So you're prepped for a fight,
Dialogue: 0,0:49:01.14,0:49:04.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then it's taken away from you, but I know that's just me.
Dialogue: 0,0:49:04.23,0:49:08.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Of course this is in the case because the second that we enter the basement, this happens.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:15.15,0:51:19.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,There are some heated discussion between the members of Abby's party as to what to do with Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:19.44,0:51:22.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's all very muffled, and you can't understand any of it,
Dialogue: 0,0:51:22.14,0:51:24.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,though we will get to see this from another perspective later.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:24.90,0:51:26.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,Eventually they just knocked her out.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:26.73,0:51:30.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,and Ellie wakes up after some time to Dina and Jesse rescuing them.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:30.94,0:51:35.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,At this point is not clear if Tommy survived, but it's clear that Joel did not.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:45.39,0:51:51.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,You know what? This is as good a time as any to address the elephant in the room dead on the floor,
Dialogue: 0,0:51:51.12,0:51:52.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,I had the game spoiled for me,
Dialogue: 0,0:51:52.41,0:51:55.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,so I knew that Joel was going to die at some point.
Dialogue: 0,0:51:55.56,0:51:56.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,And to be honest,
Dialogue: 0,0:51:56.37,0:52:01.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,many of us had a feeling as though Joel was going to die at some point in the game years ago
Dialogue: 0,0:52:01.83,0:52:03.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,because they only made sense.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:03.72,0:52:08.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,One of the stereotypes of a sequel is that they're going to kill off one of the major characters
Dialogue: 0,0:52:08.44,0:52:11.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,from the first iteration of whatever is in question,
Dialogue: 0,0:52:11.91,0:52:15.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,whether it's a movie and novel, a podcast or a video game,
Dialogue: 0,0:52:15.52,0:52:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,time and time again, we've seen this trope played out.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:18.59,0:52:22.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's become a trope because this actually works pretty well.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:22.17,0:52:27.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,You grow the character and the audience falls in love with them over the course of the first story.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:27.00,0:52:30.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,Then, with this foundation laid you pull the rug out from everybody
Dialogue: 0,0:52:30.86,0:52:34.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,and smack them over the head with a two by four of emotion.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:34.26,0:52:38.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or maybe in this case, a golf club of emotion.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:38.46,0:52:40.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,Maybe that's too soon, I don't care, moving on.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:40.62,0:52:46.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,Even with this presumption, having been established by many people before this game was launched,
Dialogue: 0,0:52:46.23,0:52:50.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,Naughty Dog seems to have actively tried to dissuade fans from this presupposition
Dialogue: 0,0:52:50.72,0:52:52.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,by way of their pre launch trailers.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:52.98,0:52:59.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now this actually got a lot of people pretty upset when they played through the entirety of TLOU2.
Dialogue: 0,0:52:59.61,0:53:02.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,There are multiple events that were shown in the trailers
Dialogue: 0,0:53:02.72,0:53:06.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,that aren't actually indicative of what the game has to offer.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:06.45,0:53:08.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,The clearest example would be this one,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:08.86,0:53:12.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,where Ellie is fighting through a bunch of WLF,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:12.00,0:53:15.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then has a hand put over her mouth,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:15.00,0:53:18.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,and when she turns round, she sees that it's Joel,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:18.06,0:53:21.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,telling her that he's not going to let her do this by herself.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:21.39,0:53:24.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now I'm not going to respond in the same way that a lot of people on Twitter responded
Dialogue: 0,0:53:24.59,0:53:27.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,where they demanded their money back to the false advertising.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:27.42,0:53:28.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't think that's fair,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:28.86,0:53:32.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially because you paid sixty dollars and have gotten a lot of game play out of it before.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:32.99,0:53:36.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,You know, I don't even need to explain my reasoning, I just think that's stupid.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:36.66,0:53:39.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,What I will say, however, was that this was very confusing,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:39.42,0:53:42.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least for me, the first time I play through the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:42.09,0:53:44.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Having watched all of the trailers multiple times,
Dialogue: 0,0:53:44.85,0:53:50.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,I knew that Joel made an appearance later on in the game because Ellie responds to him.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:50.43,0:53:53.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,But that never happens in the actual game.
Dialogue: 0,0:53:53.70,0:53:57.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,So I kept asking myself whether or not there was going to be some sort of dream sequence
Dialogue: 0,0:53:57.69,0:54:00.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,where she plays back through the same level again.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:00.33,0:54:05.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,But this time Joel is at the end of the line instead, and then that scene plays out.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:05.13,0:54:08.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,Of course, I don't have to tell you that never happens.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:08.25,0:54:11.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,This was simply a way to divert the attention from the fans
Dialogue: 0,0:54:11.86,0:54:14.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,away from what was actually going to happen.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:14.16,0:54:16.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,And Naughty Dog does have a history of doing this type of thing,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:16.68,0:54:18.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is part of the reason I can't fault them completely,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:18.99,0:54:20.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,because usually it's for a good reason.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:20.64,0:54:23.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,The most obvious example would be with the original TLOU,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:23.58,0:54:27.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,when they said that you would only be playing his Joel throughout the entirety of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:27.45,0:54:29.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,Of course, this isn't true.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:29.91,0:54:32.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it made it so when you actually get your hands on Ellie,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:32.97,0:54:36.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,that sounded weird when I said it out loud,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:36.03,0:54:38.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,it made it, so when you started playing as alley,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:38.85,0:54:45.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,the entire sequence was much more surreal because you didn't expect at all to have this opportunity.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:45.39,0:54:47.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,Another example would be with this very game,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:47.49,0:54:53.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,TLOU2 when they said that you would only be playing as Elie throughout the entirety of the campaign,
Dialogue: 0,0:54:53.28,0:54:55.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,something which was obviously not true.
Dialogue: 0,0:54:55.47,0:55:00.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,The problem with these sort of white lies to better the game play experience for the player
Dialogue: 0,0:55:00.85,0:55:04.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,is that they only work if people don't know any better.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:04.48,0:55:06.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,And with the original game, as far as I am aware,
Dialogue: 0,0:55:06.99,0:55:11.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,most people believed that you would only play as Joel throughout the entirety of the game,
Dialogue: 0,0:55:11.37,0:55:15.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it made it so when they got their hands on the controller playing as Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:15.48,0:55:19.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,It was much more interesting because they didn't expect it at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:19.98,0:55:25.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,But with TLOU2 and all of the leaks that followed, people saw this coming from a mile away,
Dialogue: 0,0:55:25.80,0:55:27.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it lost a lot of its punch.

Dialogue: 0,0:59:25.32,0:59:30.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,Tommy happened to see some patches on their coats that read "WLF".
Dialogue: 0,0:59:30.00,0:59:32.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,And because of his previous history with the Fireflies,

Dialogue: 0,0:59:38.40,0:59:39.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,Huh … Go figure.
Dialogue: 0,0:59:39.54,0:59:43.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,And that's what allows Ellie to know where she needs to go next.
Dialogue: 0,0:59:43.59,0:59:47.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a long stretch that they would have returned to Seattle
Dialogue: 0,0:59:47.60,0:59:49.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that they would still be there and that they would be findable.
Dialogue: 0,0:59:49.89,0:59:54.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,But when you're motivated this strongly, you're willing to go and try anything.

Dialogue: 0,1:00:11.31,1:00:15.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,But Tommy's main objective is to prevent Ellie from going,
Dialogue: 0,1:00:15.54,1:00:19.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,he promised Joel that he would take care of Ellie, no matter what.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:19.23,1:00:22.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,And in this case, he knows that if Ellie goes to Seattle,

Dialogue: 0,1:00:24.51,1:00:27.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,So he'd rather go take on those chances himself
Dialogue: 0,1:00:27.90,1:00:31.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,and spare Ellie while trying to get revenge for the sake of the both of them,
Dialogue: 0,1:00:31.77,1:00:33.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie demands that they either go together,
Dialogue: 0,1:00:33.69,1:00:36.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,or that Tommy allow Ellie to go with Dina
Dialogue: 0,1:00:36.56,1:00:41.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,and some other people with some troops from the camp to get revenge herself.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:41.13,1:00:46.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,Tommy, of course, rejects this idea and asks for and more time just a day or so
Dialogue: 0,1:00:46.36,1:00:48.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,so that he can try and work something out.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:48.50,1:00:50.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,In this case, he's just buying time.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:50.55,1:00:52.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,He's made up his mind as to what he's going to do.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:52.71,1:00:54.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,We then see Ellie in Joel's grave site.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:54.75,1:00:56.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a really touching moment,
Dialogue: 0,1:00:56.22,1:00:59.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it reaffirms that Joel is actually gone.

Dialogue: 0,1:01:01.35,1:01:06.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I had this sort of surreal feeling when I played through this game the first time.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:06.02,1:01:09.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,I kept saying to myself: Joel can't actually be dead.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:09.16,1:01:14.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,For one because we saw that trailer, where Joel was featured later on in the game in Seattle.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:14.23,1:01:16.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,And for two because Joel is Joel,
Dialogue: 0,1:01:16.74,1:01:21.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,you can't just kill off Joel that suddenly, there has to be more to it.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:21.42,1:01:23.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,But there isn't.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:23.52,1:01:26.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,He's dead. This is his grave and it's sad.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:26.04,1:01:28.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie then visits Joles house with Dina,
Dialogue: 0,1:01:28.04,1:01:32.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,picks up his watch from the first game, it's still broken.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:32.48,1:01:36.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,And also takes his revolver, which you'll be using throughout the rest of the game.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:36.30,1:01:39.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's actually pretty cool that this is where she gets it.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:39.63,1:01:43.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,We do this though, only after exploring his house a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,1:01:43.17,1:01:46.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,and there's a lot of incredible detail here,
Dialogue: 0,1:01:46.95,1:01:49.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it really encapsulates Joel's character.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:49.77,1:01:54.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,He's very music heavy and organized his neat and tidy,
Dialogue: 0,1:01:54.66,1:01:58.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,and his house is also painfully empty.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:58.02,1:01:59.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's a lot of big, empty rooms.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:59.97,1:02:01.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,And maybe I'm just reading too much into it,
Dialogue: 0,1:02:01.74,1:02:04.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I couldn't help but feel as though there was a lot of space
Dialogue: 0,1:02:04.55,1:02:07.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,where Ellie could have stayed if she had wanted to.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:07.17,1:02:13.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,Like I said earlier, there was no reason other than the emotional turmoil between the two
Dialogue: 0,1:02:13.76,1:02:17.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,for Ellie to go and live in the grandmother, sweet out back.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:17.01,1:02:23.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,But truly everything from the paintings on the walls which we'll come back to later, I promise to,

Dialogue: 0,1:02:32.38,1:02:35.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,like it's … it's so cute, and it's so touching,
Dialogue: 0,1:02:35.70,1:02:41.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's so painfully sad to know that he's never going to walk through that house ever again.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:41.10,1:02:42.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,After you grab these items,
Dialogue: 0,1:02:42.66,1:02:47.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,you walked downstairs and realized that Maria is there sitting with Dina.

Dialogue: 0,1:03:51.56,1:03:57.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,Having a single quest, we are just going to try and kill one person, is a little bland.

Dialogue: 0,1:24:05.16,1:24:09.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel found this museum that had a giant dinosaur statue in it
Dialogue: 0,1:24:09.16,1:24:12.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,because he knew that Ellie dreamed of seeing dinosaurs.

Dialogue: 0,1:24:34.47,1:24:38.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,This sequence is actually just like the arcade one in Left Behind
Dialogue: 0,1:24:38.79,1:24:45.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,the DLC from the first game wherein Ellie and Riley were imagining playing this video game.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:45.15,1:24:48.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,Of course they couldn't play it, it was long since broken.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:48.54,1:24:53.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,But Riley had Ellie close her eyes and imagine everything while she described it.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:53.34,1:24:57.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,You'd better believe it's no coincidence that these two events are so similar.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:57.63,1:24:59.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a super simple scene.
Dialogue: 0,1:24:59.52,1:25:07.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it just serves to further establish that Joel and Ellie had a deep relationship and care for each other.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:07.26,1:25:10.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,Also that their relationship is pretty complicated.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:10.35,1:25:15.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because at the very end of this scene you come across a writing on the wall.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:15.87,1:25:21.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,And needless to say, it's something that Joel and Ellie don't want to discuss.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:21.27,1:25:22.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,So they just leave.
Dialogue: 0,1:25:22.62,1:25:25.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,And after that we jumped to Seattle Day 2.

Dialogue: 0,1:26:08.49,1:26:11.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,Playing as Ellie, you push through a few different areas,
Dialogue: 0,1:26:11.30,1:26:14.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,fighting all sorts of wolfs and looting lots of buildings.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:15.12,1:26:17.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,Not much happens for around thirty minutes of exploring
Dialogue: 0,1:26:17.78,1:26:21.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,until all of the WLF seems to descend at the same spot,
Dialogue: 0,1:26:21.84,1:26:24.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,a smoke signal that Ellie also follows.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:24.52,1:26:27.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,The level design here is really fantastic.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:27.15,1:26:32.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,This use of a visual objective in the distance that you can follow as you go through the level.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:32.73,1:26:37.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's really well done, and it's something Naughty Dog has been doing for a long time
Dialogue: 0,1:26:37.66,1:26:39.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that they really have perfected.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:39.69,1:26:42.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now these level really crescendos in difficulty,
Dialogue: 0,1:26:42.54,1:26:47.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially in harder difficulty settings where difficulty spikes are far more severe.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:47.67,1:26:51.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now the thing about this is that you'll get caught with no ammo in this level
Dialogue: 0,1:26:51.54,1:26:54.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you're not careful and use it all too early.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:54.24,1:26:57.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,So you have to be very careful to preserve it.
Dialogue: 0,1:26:57.09,1:27:00.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the problem is on your first run through you're not going to know
Dialogue: 0,1:27:00.13,1:27:02.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,that you're going to run out of ammo so quickly.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:02.64,1:27:03.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,You couldn't have known.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:03.96,1:27:09.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,So in turn you are always careful and never want to use any of your ammo whatsoever.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:09.48,1:27:12.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,But when that's the case, you are always careful,
Dialogue: 0,1:27:12.57,1:27:17.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,which also means that you never are because your behavior isn't changing in any way.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:17.10,1:27:18.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,You are just refusing to use ammo,
Dialogue: 0,1:27:18.78,1:27:21.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,so you're effectively playing through the game as a melee game.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:21.30,1:27:26.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's this game play hesitance that I have noticed in a lot of horror video games,
Dialogue: 0,1:27:26.46,1:27:29.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially where ammo is very limited.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:29.82,1:27:36.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's strange to me because I don't think it actually reflects a better game play experience
Dialogue: 0,1:27:36.29,1:27:40.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it just ends up with the player refusing to use multiple mechanics
Dialogue: 0,1:27:40.22,1:27:42.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,because they are scared that if they do use them,
Dialogue: 0,1:27:42.36,1:27:45.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,they're going to run out of ammo and be unable to use them later on.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:45.99,1:27:51.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I understand that getting rid of this system could also be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:51.69,1:27:54.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,Though regardless, Ellie pushes to the smokestack,
Dialogue: 0,1:27:54.57,1:27:58.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,killing and evading all sorts of WLF members while she goes.
Dialogue: 0,1:27:58.26,1:28:00.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,You eventually unlock the bow and arrow here,
Dialogue: 0,1:28:00.45,1:28:04.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is actually probably my favorite weapon of the whole game.
Dialogue: 0,1:28:04.44,1:28:08.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's silent, you can recollect a lot of the ammo depending on where you hit the enemy
Dialogue: 0,1:28:08.53,1:28:10.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,and on what difficulty you're playing.
Dialogue: 0,1:28:10.86,1:28:14.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,And all around I just like it, I find it really satisfying.
Dialogue: 0,1:28:14.61,1:28:19.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,She reaches the location of the smoke stack, and then this happens.
Dialogue: 0,1:28:48.00,1:28:53.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is really weird to me … because …
Dialogue: 0,1:28:53.02,1:28:56.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,as far as I knew, this was going to be Joel when Ellie turned around,
Dialogue: 0,1:28:56.97,1:29:01.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I was really confused when I saw that we were getting to that point where the trailer happened.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:01.64,1:29:03.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I knew that Joel was dead.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:03.69,1:29:05.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,How could he possibly show up and save the day?
Dialogue: 0,1:29:05.79,1:29:08.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,But sure enough, it ends up being Jesse.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:08.88,1:29:13.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's just strange to me that they chose to do this fake out,
Dialogue: 0,1:29:13.02,1:29:17.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,where we thought that it was going to be Joel here,
Dialogue: 0,1:29:17.07,1:29:18.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,because that's what the trailer showed,
Dialogue: 0,1:29:18.87,1:29:23.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then it ends up being just … It's just it's weird … It's weird to me.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:23.07,1:29:24.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't know what else to say.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:24.30,1:29:27.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you have more information on this, let me know in the comments section below,
Dialogue: 0,1:29:27.06,1:29:29.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,I just …  it's weird. I don't know what to make of it.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:29.64,1:29:33.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,Nonetheless, Ellie and Jessie managed to escape by way of a stolen car
Dialogue: 0,1:29:33.12,1:29:39.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they drive into a river in a pretty impressive sequence that also leaked pre launch.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:39.48,1:29:43.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a superfluid sequence, and no, I'm not just saying that because they end up in a river,
Dialogue: 0,1:29:43.47,1:29:47.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think it's very well polished and it looks incredible to boot.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:47.76,1:29:51.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,But then again, I mean, this is a Naughty Dog game wouldn't expect anything else.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:51.78,1:29:55.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,You bring Jesse back to Dina and there's a ton of tension here.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:55.77,1:29:59.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie, of course, leaves because she feels very awkward.
Dialogue: 0,1:29:59.07,1:30:03.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all Ellie's girlfriend's baby daddy just showed up.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:03.54,1:30:05.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't blame her for wanting to leave.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:05.44,1:30:10.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,As Ellie walks away, we jump into another flashback, and this one's actually pretty simple.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:10.56,1:30:14.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie and Joel are exploring a hotel while on their way to a music store
Dialogue: 0,1:30:14.10,1:30:17.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,after Ellie receives a lesson on sniping from Tommy.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:17.73,1:30:19.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this may seem really random,
Dialogue: 0,1:30:19.14,1:30:25.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially because sniping will not be a major mechanic for Ellie throughout the entire game.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:25.11,1:30:31.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,But there actually is a reason for them showing the player this sniping tutorial.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:31.02,1:30:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'll get to that more in a little bit, though.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:33.52,1:30:40.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,After you finish your sniping tutorial with Tommy, ride back down the hill and find Joel sitting there
Dialogue: 0,1:30:40.08,1:30:45.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,and you prepare to go out with him to find some guitar strings at a music store.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:45.66,1:30:52.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now, A fun little detail is that this actually was originally an entirely different plot.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:52.53,1:30:56.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,Originally after Ellie finished her sniping tutorial with Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,1:30:56.55,1:31:03.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,she and Joel were going to go and say Hi to Joels girlfriend who lived just a little ways down the road.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:03.21,1:31:08.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,They were going to ride up, find Joel's girlfriend having been freshly bitten
Dialogue: 0,1:31:08.76,1:31:11.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they were going to be forced to make a difficult choice.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:11.46,1:31:15.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,While they all negotiated back and forth what they should do about it,
Dialogue: 0,1:31:15.15,1:31:19.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,they send Ellie outside to grab some fresh water from the stream.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:19.49,1:31:23.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,Once Ellie walks outside, she hears a gunshot,
Dialogue: 0,1:31:23.01,1:31:27.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then Joel walks out, and they know that something happened.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:27.00,1:31:29.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,They know that … she's gone.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:29.79,1:31:34.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,And either Joel put her out of her misery at her request,
Dialogue: 0,1:31:34.11,1:31:39.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,or she put herself out of her own misery because she knew that she didn't want Joel have to do it for her,
Dialogue: 0,1:31:39.63,1:31:41.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,because they knew how this was going to end.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:41.76,1:31:45.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, it would have been a very touching moment
Dialogue: 0,1:31:45.60,1:31:50.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,and interesting thing to see Joel and Ellie experience together.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:50.85,1:31:56.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel experiencing another loss and using Ellie to help him get through it.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:56.07,1:32:03.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,But apparently, according to the press release and comments by Neil Druckmann and all of his writing staff,
Dialogue: 0,1:32:03.81,1:32:07.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,this scene was cut in favor of this new scene
Dialogue: 0,1:32:07.18,1:32:11.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,where they go and explore a hotel cutting through to a music store.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:11.07,1:32:16.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because they felt as though it was too much of a diversion from the priorities of the story.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:16.35,1:32:21.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,In other words, this is a game about Ellie, it's not a game about Joel.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:21.33,1:32:28.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,And if they had this scene focused on Joel, it would start to feel much more like a Joel AND Ellie Game.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:28.56,1:32:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,But a Joel and Ellie game, where your only playing as Ellie, but make of that what you will.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:33.52,1:32:36.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,You cut through the resort, clearing out a ton of infected
Dialogue: 0,1:32:36.42,1:32:40.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it actually feels a lot like the first game, it's pretty nice.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:40.23,1:32:44.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,As they pushed through the resort, Joel insists that Ellie wear her mask,

Dialogue: 0,1:32:47.67,1:32:50.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,she asks why she'd would need to do this,
Dialogue: 0,1:32:50.04,1:32:52.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,after all, it's just them exploring the hotel.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:52.56,1:32:57.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,And he says, because if somebody saw her, they would have a lot of questions understandably.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:57.60,1:33:00.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,So it's better to be safe than sorry, she should just wear it.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:00.66,1:33:02.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,and this explains why she was wearing it
Dialogue: 0,1:33:02.63,1:33:05.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,and all of the other sequences like we talked about at the beginning.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:05.85,1:33:11.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,She wore the mask at Joel's insistence because she didn't want to risk anybody finding out
Dialogue: 0,1:33:11.28,1:33:13.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it would cause too much trouble,
Dialogue: 0,1:33:13.47,1:33:17.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,or it just wasn't worth the headache of explaining everything that went down with the fireflies,
Dialogue: 0,1:33:17.67,1:33:22.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,even if Joel was going to stick to his original story of what happened.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:22.20,1:33:26.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,But after pushing through a ton of infected fighting, a mini boss fight with Joel again,

Dialogue: 0,1:41:13.70,1:41:18.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then the other case being that you kill them before they are able to disembowel him,

Dialogue: 0,1:41:38.99,1:41:41.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's less fluid, but it's still awesome.
Dialogue: 0,1:41:41.99,1:41:47.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,What I mean by that is that there seems to be a lot less scripted elements and animations.
Dialogue: 0,1:41:47.00,1:41:50.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,But to be honest, you'd probably expect that from a trailer.
Dialogue: 0,1:41:50.09,1:41:52.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now there are grunts in the back room during this fight,
Dialogue: 0,1:41:52.88,1:41:56.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,which actually makes this a really difficult to encounter a new game plus
Dialogue: 0,1:41:56.26,1:42:00.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,considering that I had used all of my ammo by the time that I got here,
Dialogue: 0,1:42:00.65,1:42:04.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,meaning that I had to take him on pretty much entirely with melee.
Dialogue: 0,1:42:04.10,1:42:10.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now one of the frustrations with TLOU is that it requires a lot of trial and error.
Dialogue: 0,1:42:10.97,1:42:15.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,A lot of the time the only way to figure out exactly how to get through a particular encounter
Dialogue: 0,1:42:15.64,1:42:18.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,is by dying repeatedly and trying again.
Dialogue: 0,1:42:18.65,1:42:20.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,The worst examples would be, for instance,
Dialogue: 0,1:42:20.63,1:42:23.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,this scene where I had to run around into the back room,

Dialogue: 0,1:42:41.90,1:42:44.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's visually fascinating as a scene,
Dialogue: 0,1:42:44.63,1:42:49.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,but on survivor it took around thirty minutes of experimenting to find the path
Dialogue: 0,1:42:49.61,1:42:52.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,that just narrowly dodged everybody's perception.
Dialogue: 0,1:42:52.94,1:42:55.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,And even then I'm not convinced that I should have escaped
Dialogue: 0,1:42:55.84,1:43:01.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,because I got in the boat, started it and was spotted and then shot started coming in,
Dialogue: 0,1:43:01.55,1:43:04.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,at which point a lot of bullets definitely hit Ellie,
Dialogue: 0,1:43:04.94,1:43:08.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,and she probably should have died, but I was still allowed to escape.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:08.74,1:43:12.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,From what I can tell Naughty Dog tweaked their aim while you're inside this boat
Dialogue: 0,1:43:12.88,1:43:15.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,to make it feel as though you are whizzing past incoming fire.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:15.62,1:43:18.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,But here I actually forgot that the boat controls in this game
Dialogue: 0,1:43:18.83,1:43:22.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,are defaulted to the stupidest lay out possible.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:22.37,1:43:25.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,So I sat there for a second holding down are too like a chump
Dialogue: 0,1:43:25.35,1:43:29.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,before I realized that it was all steered using the left stick,
Dialogue: 0,1:43:29.42,1:43:31.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,and by the time I figured it out,
Dialogue: 0,1:43:31.37,1:43:34.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,I definitely should have died, but nonetheless I was allowed to live.
Dialogue: 0,1:43:34.34,1:43:37.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,So the player and Ellie pushed to the hospital after the fight with the mini boss.

Dialogue: 0,1:56:26.20,1:56:29.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,seemed to be operating in their regular profession just fine.
Dialogue: 0,1:56:29.42,1:56:30.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,So at the end of the day,

Dialogue: 0,1:56:55.73,1:57:00.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,Over the course of the sequence, they determined that she has to return to Jackson.

Dialogue: 0,1:57:01.60,1:57:07.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,If she is to receive any semblance of healthcare in the lead up to the delivery of the child,
Dialogue: 0,1:57:07.37,1:57:10.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,she's going to need to return to where they came from.
Dialogue: 0,1:57:10.07,1:57:13.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,This, in turn means that this is likely their last chance to find Abby,
Dialogue: 0,1:57:13.73,1:57:15.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,because once they find Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,1:57:15.53,1:57:18.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,they're all going to pack up and head back to Jackson together.
Dialogue: 0,1:57:18.50,1:57:24.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,Chances are Jesse and Dina, and especially Tommy, are not going to allow Ellie to remain.

Dialogue: 0,1:57:29.74,1:57:35.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's keeping it a secret, which seems kind of stupid, but I guess that's just me.
Dialogue: 0,1:57:35.42,1:57:38.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, the motivations have shifted.
Dialogue: 0,1:57:38.27,1:57:43.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,Jesse is not as concerned about finding Abby and getting revenge.
Dialogue: 0,1:57:43.07,1:57:47.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,Rather, he's looking for Tommy so that they can all return to Jackson together
Dialogue: 0,1:57:47.15,1:57:49.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,whereas Ellie claims the same.
Dialogue: 0,1:57:49.01,1:57:53.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, she is much more concerned with finding Abby as we'll see in just a moment.
Dialogue: 0,1:57:53.87,1:57:59.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,This whole climaxes when Jesse and Ellie here over a radio that there's a sniper on the pier,
Dialogue: 0,1:57:59.18,1:58:03.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,that's taking out a bunch of WLF members in causing trouble more generally.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:03.56,1:58:05.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,Jesse and Ellie determined that this has to be Tommy.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:05.93,1:58:10.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's actually a fair point because the WLF wouldn't be sniping themselves.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:10.85,1:58:16.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the Scars don't actually use sniper rifles in this way, so it's likely not them.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:16.85,1:58:19.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,So it's either Tommy or another rogue individual
Dialogue: 0,1:58:19.90,1:58:23.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,who happens to just be sniping WLF members for fun.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:23.45,1:58:26.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,And of course it ends up being Tommy at the end of the day,
Dialogue: 0,1:58:26.51,1:58:30.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,but it's here that we see Ellie make a decision that's much harder to justify.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:30.47,1:58:35.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,She insists that Tommy is going to be OK by himself and that he doesn't need her help.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:35.48,1:58:39.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,While this is perhaps true, it's more the thought that counts.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:39.32,1:58:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,Of course, Tommy has made it this long.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:41.30,1:58:43.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the fact that he sniping WLF members
Dialogue: 0,1:58:43.96,1:58:48.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,shows that he's at least somewhat confident in his abilities to deal with them.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:48.32,1:58:54.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, Ellie isn't saying this because she wants to protect Jesse or herself, or Dina's well being.
Dialogue: 0,1:58:54.85,1:59:00.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,Rather, she's seeing it purely because she wants to get to Abbey quickly, kill her,
Dialogue: 0,1:59:00.08,1:59:04.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then be able to leave with Tommy, Jesse and Dina back to Jackson,

Dialogue: 0,2:01:31.25,2:01:34.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,and especially this sequence is absolutely ridiculous,
Dialogue: 0,2:01:34.43,2:01:38.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I have to applaud all of the developers over a Naughty Dog for their hard work.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:38.42,2:01:39.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,But with that out of the way,

Dialogue: 0,2:01:50.32,2:01:52.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,With the context we have in the game so far,
Dialogue: 0,2:01:52.64,2:01:57.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,we assume that there must have been some strange torture session going on here and nothing more.
Dialogue: 0,2:01:57.83,2:02:02.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, as we'll see later, this wasn't as terrible as it seems.
Dialogue: 0,2:02:02.69,2:02:06.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie climbs into an air duct, and then the following sequence plays out.

Dialogue: 0,2:02:39.71,2:02:44.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, it was shown off in the trailers, as just some mud that you put down.

Dialogue: 0,2:06:03.59,2:06:07.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,Needless to say, this is a deeply upsetting sequence.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:07.67,2:06:10.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's one that I personally saw coming a mile away.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:10.61,2:06:13.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,You see one thing I do know about the writer's over a Naughty Dog,

Dialogue: 0,2:06:15.47,2:06:17.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,is that they love their similes.

Dialogue: 0,2:06:20.36,2:06:24.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,It gives you a chance to see how these two different people respond to similar situations.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:24.92,2:06:30.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so whenever you start to see things that are similar or things that characters have in common,
Dialogue: 0,2:06:30.20,2:06:32.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,you have to assume that the developers and writers
Dialogue: 0,2:06:32.57,2:06:38.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,are going to force those two characters into a similar situation where those similarities can come out.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:38.18,2:06:42.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,In this case, Ellie's girlfriend, Dina, is pregnant.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:42.29,2:06:46.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,And one of the first things that we hear about Owen and Abby's group in general
Dialogue: 0,2:06:46.83,2:06:48.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,is that Mel is pregnant.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:48.87,2:06:51.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,At this point in the game we don't know who Mel is
Dialogue: 0,2:06:51.83,2:06:55.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,when we're standing on this snowy hillside overlooking Jackson.
Dialogue: 0,2:06:55.49,2:06:58.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I personally knew that there was a very good chance
Dialogue: 0,2:06:55.49,2:07:02.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,that Ellie would end up killing her pregnant friend Mel
Dialogue: 0,2:07:02.28,2:07:05.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,simply because Dina was likely going to end a pregnant as well.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:05.78,2:07:08.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,And sure enough, when Dina is revealed to be pregnant,
Dialogue: 0,2:07:08.69,2:07:10.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,this point was solidified for me.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:10.47,2:07:15.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now besides the predictability of this plot point, I have to ask one other question,
Dialogue: 0,2:07:15.02,2:07:20.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is whether or not Ellie would have actually killed Owen and Mel if they had tattled on Abbey.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:20.93,2:07:24.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,And given what we know about Ellie in this game,
Dialogue: 0,2:07:24.53,2:07:27.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think the odds are pretty good that she probably would have.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:27.60,2:07:31.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's horrible to say, but Ellie was here for revenge.

Dialogue: 0,2:07:44.06,2:07:46.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,which objectively probably would have been the smarter thing to do,
Dialogue: 0,2:07:46.97,2:07:49.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially considering how TLOU2 plays out.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:49.91,2:07:53.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, she technically owes her life to Owen.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:53.69,2:07:56.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,Even so, I think she would have killed him.
Dialogue: 0,2:07:56.15,2:08:00.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,The other question that you have to ask is where is Abby and what happened.
Dialogue: 0,2:08:00.14,2:08:01.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,Where did she go?
Dialogue: 0,2:08:01.22,2:08:04.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,How long is it going to be before she finds out what Ellie is done?

Dialogue: 0,2:08:07.19,2:08:09.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now it's implied that she's fleeing from Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,2:08:09.77,2:08:12.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, this doesn't really make a lot of sense,

Dialogue: 0,2:08:16.82,2:08:22.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,It seems as though she's involved in something that's taking her away from her duties within the WLF,
Dialogue: 0,2:08:22.25,2:08:24.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why Isaac seems to be upset with her.
Dialogue: 0,2:08:24.44,2:08:28.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, I think Naughty Dog is trying to keep the story moving along
Dialogue: 0,2:08:28.28,2:08:33.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,so that you don't think about it long enough to realize that there's got to be more to it.
Dialogue: 0,2:08:33.08,2:08:34.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,And honestly, I'm okay with that.
Dialogue: 0,2:08:34.67,2:08:38.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,Especially because Ellie herself isn't particularly interested

Dialogue: 0,2:08:42.04,2:08:45.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,or why Abby seems to be at odds with the rest of her group.

Dialogue: 0,2:08:47.96,2:08:52.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the last thing about this sequence is that I can't help but feel as though it's a little strange

Dialogue: 0,2:09:17.84,2:09:22.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,it seems odd that they wouldn't have done a more elaborate check throughout the rest of the building.

Dialogue: 0,2:09:29.36,2:09:33.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,Perhaps at this point, they have just accepted that they're not going to find Abby.

Dialogue: 0,2:48:30.59,2:48:34.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,the Seraphites cult wasn't about living incongruity with nature,
Dialogue: 0,2:48:34.82,2:48:41.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,but rather was much more about control and strict adherence to the guidance and dictum of the elders.
Dialogue: 0,2:48:41.75,2:48:44.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is an interesting choice by Naughty Dogs riders.
Dialogue: 0,2:48:44.48,2:48:50.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,Specifically because it makes it so that the Seraphites followers are much more relatable and sympathetic.

Dialogue: 0,2:48:51.72,2:48:57.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,they're employing some very animalistic and barbarian tactic to achieve a certain ends,

Dialogue: 0,2:49:03.11,2:49:05.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,you can always fall back and partially excuse it
Dialogue: 0,2:49:05.92,2:49:10.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,because these are people simply following directions that they believe are coming from on high.

Dialogue: 0,2:49:19.31,2:49:25.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,Rather, they're people simply trying to survive in a world that's really really messed up.
Dialogue: 0,2:49:25.10,2:49:28.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's no mystery that this is set up right around the time
Dialogue: 0,2:49:28.16,2:49:35.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,when Abby is starting to feel sympathy towards members, or in this case, former members of the cult.
Dialogue: 0,2:49:35.39,2:49:37.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again this game is all about perspectives.
Dialogue: 0,2:49:37.88,2:49:40.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's all about trying to get you to sympathise
Dialogue: 0,2:49:40.33,2:49:44.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,with people that you didn't think you could possibly sympathize with before.
Dialogue: 0,2:49:44.28,2:49:47.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is, the Prophet is a very interesting character,
Dialogue: 0,2:49:47.93,2:49:53.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,specifically considering the control that she seems to have over the Seraphites.
Dialogue: 0,2:49:53.36,2:49:58.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, without many details on exactly when she died or how she died,
Dialogue: 0,2:49:58.16,2:50:01.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's unclear at just how long she's been gone.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:01.52,2:50:04.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,It would be one thing if she had been dead for just a few years,
Dialogue: 0,2:50:04.82,2:50:07.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,and this is what starting to ramp up.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:07.28,2:50:12.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's an entirely another case for her to have been dead for ten or fifteen years,
Dialogue: 0,2:50:12.29,2:50:18.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,leading to over a decade of power struggles, which eventually bred this new, morphed cult.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:18.62,2:50:21.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, I think the Seraphites are fairly interesting.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:21.83,2:50:25.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,At the very least they are a little bit different and they offer a fresh perspective
Dialogue: 0,2:50:25.81,2:50:31.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,on how a group of people might go about surviving in a world that's this messed up.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:31.04,2:50:36.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,I especially like it because so often these types of narratives are completely drowned out
Dialogue: 0,2:50:36.84,2:50:42.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,with cannibals and barbarians and looters and raiders,
Dialogue: 0,2:50:42.11,2:50:45.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,and basically everybody that you encountered in the first game.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:45.29,2:50:49.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's only in these more interesting and creative, in my opinion, stories
Dialogue: 0,2:50:49.92,2:50:52.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,where you find something that's a little bit different.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:52.91,2:50:58.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,Such as in Mad Max, the strange obsession and worship of gasoline and cars.
Dialogue: 0,2:50:58.79,2:51:01.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's something that's just really cool, and different.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:01.64,2:51:02.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I digress.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:02.90,2:51:08.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby pushes through this checkpoint and officially enters Scars' territory.

Dialogue: 0,2:51:11.59,2:51:15.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,and believe me, you're going to be ploughing through them by the end of this sequence.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:23.09,2:51:26.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,There's actually a great many boss fight here that I really enjoyed
Dialogue: 0,2:51:26.06,2:51:29.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,with a woman that I can only assume is named Helga.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:29.12,2:51:32.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't actually know if her name is Helga by the way
Dialogue: 0,2:51:32.12,2:51:34.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'm just saying that because she looks like Helga.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:34.28,2:51:38.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,But regardless Abby bites off a part of her ear, which I thought was kind of funny.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:38.93,2:51:41.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,But eventually a bunch of her friends come over.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:41.00,2:51:43.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,They overpower Abby and knock her out,
Dialogue: 0,2:51:43.10,2:51:47.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,which then leads straight into a flashback to four months before.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:47.55,2:51:52.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,This would place this flashback right before the events of the prologue,
Dialogue: 0,2:51:52.43,2:51:55.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,when Abby and her whole group left for Jackson.
Dialogue: 0,2:51:55.55,2:52:00.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's Winter, Abby finds Owen in the aquarium with a bunch of pretty lights put up.

Dialogue: 0,2:52:01.73,2:52:05.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it really is this calming contrast that's the name of the game for the second half of TLOU2.
Dialogue: 0,2:52:05.72,2:52:10.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,Something horrible will happen,
Dialogue: 0,2:52:10.52,2:52:13.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then we'll see something pretty and relaxing,

Dialogue: 0,2:52:16.19,2:52:19.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then we cut back to a nice winter scene, and so on.
Dialogue: 0,2:52:19.68,2:52:24.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,In here there's actually many game where you can shoot some targets with a kitty bow and arrow.
Dialogue: 0,2:52:24.17,2:52:29.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's pretty damn stupid, but it gives the players something to do that isn't just talking.
Dialogue: 0,2:52:29.15,2:52:34.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Otherwise this entire flashback would simply be Abby, talking to Owen,
Dialogue: 0,2:52:34.04,2:52:37.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,walking up some stairs and then talking some more.
Dialogue: 0,2:52:37.04,2:52:42.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's not to say that Naughty Dogs afraid of doing that in games or having a 10 minute cut scene,
Dialogue: 0,2:52:42.44,2:52:45.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,but it seems to me that if they can avoid it, they will,
Dialogue: 0,2:52:45.47,2:52:49.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they'll interspersed little mini game such as this to break up the monotony.
Dialogue: 0,2:52:49.48,2:52:53.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now the point of the sequence, though, is to show that Abby found Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,2:52:53.45,2:52:57.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,or, at the very least has a lead that he's living in Jackson.
Dialogue: 0,2:52:57.56,2:53:02.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the point, of course, is that they hope that Tommy could help them find Joel.

Dialogue: 0,2:53:05.24,2:53:08.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,But apparently, at this time Abby didn't know that.

Dialogue: 0,2:53:18.02,2:53:22.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I mean some of the dialogue seems to imply that she's looking for Joel primarily,

Dialogue: 0,2:53:25.25,2:53:28.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,But again, I just don't think it matters too much.
Dialogue: 0,2:53:28.01,2:53:32.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,The point is they're going to Jackson for Joel by way of Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,2:53:32.78,2:53:35.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,and if Joel happens to be there, great.
Dialogue: 0,2:53:35.03,2:53:41.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,But they mostly expect to find Tommy and hope to convince him to share Joel's location or whereabouts.
Dialogue: 0,2:53:41.42,2:53:45.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless after breaking to Owen that she has a lead on Joel's brother
Dialogue: 0,2:53:45.78,2:53:49.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby also throws out the fact that Isaac approved the whole squad,

Dialogue: 0,2:53:52.88,2:53:56.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,She exclaims that Isaac is more about justice than any one,
Dialogue: 0,2:53:56.69,2:54:01.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why he apparently approves of the plan for them to leave for weeks and weeks on end,

Dialogue: 0,2:54:07.79,2:54:11.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,To me, it seems like a stretch that he would be willing to let this many people go,

Dialogue: 0,2:54:21.84,2:54:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,And may be it actually is within Isaacs character to let them go but it seems like a stretch to me.
Dialogue: 0,2:54:28.22,2:54:31.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,After a brief debate back and forth, they settle on it.

Dialogue: 0,3:14:21.29,3:14:23.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,This level feels completely fair.
Dialogue: 0,3:14:23.18,3:14:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,It just seems like a difficult situation where Lev and Abby have to work perfectly in tandem.

Dialogue: 0,3:15:44.15,3:15:46.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,Maybe even claiming it for themselves.

Dialogue: 0,3:16:24.65,3:16:28.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least as far as I'm concerned, because it comes out of absolutely nowhere.

Dialogue: 0,3:19:22.42,3:19:27.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,That Naughty Dog seems to just be recycling the same maps and levels with different characters,

Dialogue: 0,3:19:30.61,3:19:35.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I don't think it's actually fair to criticise them purely because they reuse levels.
Dialogue: 0,3:19:35.26,3:19:39.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,A level in a video game at least seems to be, in my estimation,

Dialogue: 0,3:19:43.08,3:19:46.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,and in general, a pool of possibilities.
Dialogue: 0,3:19:46.33,3:19:51.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,Different things that the player can do to interact with that level to achieve a set goal.
Dialogue: 0,3:19:51.43,3:19:54.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,A really simple level would just be a room with a door.

Dialogue: 0,3:19:59.08,3:20:04.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, a complicated level would be one in which you have a complicated goal,

Dialogue: 0,3:20:07.53,3:20:11.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,And then the developer complicates the achieving of that goal
Dialogue: 0,3:20:11.17,3:20:16.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,by introducing many different enemies that you could fight complicated traversal,
Dialogue: 0,3:20:16.33,3:20:20.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,or maybe even a puzzle that you have to solve in order to get through the door.
Dialogue: 0,3:20:20.29,3:20:23.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is how you take a level from something as simple as walking through a door
Dialogue: 0,3:20:23.94,3:20:26.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,into something more complicated and engaging for the player.
Dialogue: 0,3:20:26.83,3:20:27.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,For this reason,
Dialogue: 0,3:20:27.55,3:20:32.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't think it's completely fair to say that Naughty Dog is purely reusing levels here.
Dialogue: 0,3:20:32.65,3:20:38.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because Abby and Ellie interact with these levels in completely different ways.

Dialogue: 0,3:20:56.62,3:20:59.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,And when you compare this to Ellie traverse this level,
Dialogue: 0,3:20:59.35,3:21:01.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,well, it's pretty different.
Dialogue: 0,3:21:01.25,3:21:05.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now if your point is that they are clearly taking short cuts in terms of development
Dialogue: 0,3:21:05.95,3:21:10.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,by putting these characters in the same levels and structuring the story in that way,
Dialogue: 0,3:21:10.84,3:21:14.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think you can make that point, and perhaps that's fair.
Dialogue: 0,3:21:14.89,3:21:20.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't see the inherent problem with reusing a level if it makes sense in the story
Dialogue: 0,3:21:20.64,3:21:24.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,or if you write the story in a way where that makes sense
Dialogue: 0,3:21:24.54,3:21:29.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,because a quality game can be set in something as small as a couple of hallways.
Dialogue: 0,3:21:29.86,3:21:33.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,Look at something like PT, which was technically just a playable teaser,
Dialogue: 0,3:21:33.70,3:21:36.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,but even that was considered to be wildly successful,
Dialogue: 0,3:21:36.85,3:21:43.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it only really took place in two hallways, a back room and a bathroom I suppose.
Dialogue: 0,3:21:43.65,3:21:47.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,That's really all there was to it, and yet it was phenomenal.
Dialogue: 0,3:21:47.17,3:21:49.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,You can knit pick something as simple as

Dialogue: 0,3:21:53.11,3:21:57.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,or you can argue your point based on how the game uses that asset.
Dialogue: 0,3:21:57.76,3:22:01.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think the latter is much more reasonable and much more defensible.
Dialogue: 0,3:22:01.78,3:22:03.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I digress.
Dialogue: 0,3:22:03.19,3:22:07.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby heads into the hospital alone, leaving Lev behind because quite obviously,
Dialogue: 0,3:22:07.81,3:22:12.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,if Lev were seen anywhere near the hospital, we wouldn't survive for very long.
Dialogue: 0,3:22:12.55,3:22:15.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby plays it cool with all of the WLF members.
Dialogue: 0,3:22:15.43,3:22:20.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's only a matter of time before everybody finds out that Abby's disobeyed Isaac's orders.
Dialogue: 0,3:22:20.29,3:22:23.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think Abby knows this, which is why she's moving through the level pretty quickly,

Dialogue: 0,3:22:26.62,3:22:30.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean not to mention also that the girl that she's getting the materials for
Dialogue: 0,3:22:30.56,3:22:33.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,is on death's door that probably motivates her,
Dialogue: 0,3:22:33.64,3:22:37.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,her rushing a little bit, but by who am I to say.
Dialogue: 0,3:22:37.01,3:22:40.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,You walk through here, talking a few people and … oh look!
Dialogue: 0,3:22:40.63,3:22:47.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's the Vita girl that Ellie stabbed and crap out of earlier, or I guess later,
Dialogue: 0,3:22:47.35,3:22:50.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,because he or she is still alive, that's … that's funny.
Dialogue: 0,3:22:50.24,3:22:53.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now Abby doesn't make it far into the hospital though.

Dialogue: 0,3:22:58.57,3:23:01.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,so she's locked up in the elevator.
Dialogue: 0,3:23:01.21,3:23:06.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's basically gonna held until they transport everything back to the front base with Isaac,

Dialogue: 0,3:23:08.09,3:23:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again this is something that was mentioned several times,

Dialogue: 0,3:23:36.34,3:23:39.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a pretty big deal because without a doubt,

Dialogue: 0,3:23:43.27,3:23:46.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,I could have seen an alternative timeline or storyline

Dialogue: 0,3:24:00.34,3:24:04.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I understand that this is probably a little more relatable,
Dialogue: 0,3:24:04.27,3:24:08.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially because when you can emotionally attached the player to one character,
Dialogue: 0,3:24:08.86,3:24:12.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,in this case, Yara, and in another instance Lev.

Dialogue: 0,3:24:36.10,3:24:40.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's because they think that Nora let Abby go, because well, she did.

Dialogue: 0,3:29:56.68,3:30:01.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,difficulty in this game tends to come from the quantity of enemies.

Dialogue: 0,3:31:57.58,3:31:59.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,it seemed as though that was implying that

Dialogue: 0,3:32:27.10,3:32:31.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,Maybe it's just because they saved her life when they didn't need to.

Dialogue: 0,3:32:48.52,3:32:51.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think is incredibly significant.

Dialogue: 0,3:33:12.25,3:33:16.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,SEATTLE Day 3, Abby wakes up to drama brewing.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:16.03,3:33:18.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,She slept well, but Mel is pissed.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:18.67,3:33:23.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,And basically she just wants Abby to leave her Owen and the new kids alone.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:23.29,3:33:27.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,She says that if Abby sticks along for any longer than she's going to screw everything up.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:27.66,3:33:33.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,So she might as well leave them to go to Santa Barbara by themselves and remain here with the WLF.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:33.37,3:33:38.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean the drama kind of makes sense, considering that Abby just slept with Mel's baby daddy.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:38.52,3:33:42.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I don't know if she knows this, or if she know and talked about it.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:42.22,3:33:47.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,But either way, it upsets Abby pretty significantly, and Abby actually starts to cry,

Dialogue: 0,3:33:51.49,3:33:52.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I think this hits hard for Abby,
Dialogue: 0,3:33:52.93,3:33:56.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,because she probably knows that it's true, at least to some extent.
Dialogue: 0,3:33:56.46,3:33:59.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean she is kind of toxic,
Dialogue: 0,3:33:59.04,3:34:03.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,she literally dragged a group of her closest friends halfway across the country,
Dialogue: 0,3:34:03.10,3:34:04.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,just to murder a dude.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:04.36,3:34:08.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,Meanwhile, Yara is dealing with Lev, who's come to the naive conclusion
Dialogue: 0,3:34:08.40,3:34:12.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,that he can convince their mother to join them in abandoning the cult.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:12.45,3:34:17.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,Yara, of course, realizes that this is a naive and stupid estimation
Dialogue: 0,3:34:17.30,3:34:18.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,of what they could do with their mother.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:18.70,3:34:22.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless Lev is convinced that there is a way.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:22.12,3:34:27.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,So Abby and Yara look for a gift that they can give to Lev, to make him feel better and stay.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:27.64,3:34:31.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now it's during this chapter that the elephant in the room comes out,
Dialogue: 0,3:34:31.69,3:34:34.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's something that I'm sure many of us saw coming,
Dialogue: 0,3:34:34.12,3:34:38.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially if you've been listening to the passive dialogue for the last few hours of gameplay.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:38.86,3:34:41.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,You see, Lev is trans.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:41.16,3:34:44.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,In some of the previous combat sequences when you're moving with Lev through,
Dialogue: 0,3:34:44.38,3:34:48.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,for instance, the construction site in fighting a lot of Seraphites,
Dialogue: 0,3:34:48.10,3:34:53.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,there's times when the Seraphites will actually call out to Lev, referring to him as Lily.
Dialogue: 0,3:34:53.86,3:34:57.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now if you've been kind of mentally checked out for the majority of the game,
Dialogue: 0,3:34:57.04,3:35:00.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,this might come as a total shock, or it might just be confusing
Dialogue: 0,3:35:00.34,3:35:04.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,as to why they're referring to this character as Lily and not Lev.
Dialogue: 0,3:35:04.18,3:35:08.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's for that very reason that Yara and Lev left the group.
Dialogue: 0,3:35:08.74,3:35:11.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,Lev was to be married off to one of the elders.
Dialogue: 0,3:35:11.17,3:35:15.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Naturally, Lev did not agree with this or like the idea,
Dialogue: 0,3:35:15.16,3:35:18.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,and so started acting out eventually, cutting his hair,
Dialogue: 0,3:35:18.16,3:35:23.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,and fully transitioning, wanting to be referred to entreated as a male Seraphite,
Dialogue: 0,3:35:23.50,3:35:27.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,going out on patrols being trained and used as a soldier.
Dialogue: 0,3:35:27.49,3:35:30.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,And in what comes as absolutely no surprise to anybody,
Dialogue: 0,3:35:30.25,3:35:34.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,the Seraphites weren't exactly the most supportive of this transition.
Dialogue: 0,3:35:34.09,3:35:38.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,So they decided that they were going to severely punish Lev,
Dialogue: 0,3:35:38.32,3:35:43.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, we're not going to allow this alternative lifestyle, shall we say.
Dialogue: 0,3:35:43.93,3:35:50.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so Yara being a supportive and strong sister decided to come out with Lev and help them escape.
Dialogue: 0,3:35:50.95,3:35:55.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is, of course, why they're constantly referred to as apostate by the Seraphites,
Dialogue: 0,3:35:55.90,3:35:59.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,and why so many of the Seraphites in combat sequences
Dialogue: 0,3:35:59.11,3:36:03.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,will call out and ask Yara and Lev why they're doing what they're doing.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:03.37,3:36:07.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because as far as they knew up until very recently, they were just fine.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:07.51,3:36:10.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now there's been a lot of hubbub about this plot point.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:10.36,3:36:11.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,There has been a lot of debate,
Dialogue: 0,3:36:11.56,3:36:15.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,both left and right of centre as to whether or not this was handled well.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:15.64,3:36:16.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,And to be honest,
Dialogue: 0,3:36:16.90,3:36:20.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'm not really qualified to come to a determination on that point.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:20.47,3:36:23.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,But to me it seemed to be handled relatively well,
Dialogue: 0,3:36:23.65,3:36:26.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,though in this particular scene in the aquarium
Dialogue: 0,3:36:26.20,3:36:29.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,when Yara and Abby are talking about it.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:29.17,3:36:30.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,It does seem a little heavy handed.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:30.98,3:36:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,When I first figured it out for sure was a few hours before this,
Dialogue: 0,3:36:34.66,3:36:40.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,when Lev and Abby were exploring the tower together and Lev actually asks Abby,
Dialogue: 0,3:36:40.27,3:36:43.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,whether or not she heard what the other Seraphites were calling him.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:43.63,3:36:45.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,This, of course, was referencing the fact
Dialogue: 0,3:36:45.55,3:36:50.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,that the Seraphites constantly referred to Lev as Lily, or as the apostate.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:50.50,3:36:54.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby said she was aware of this, but that she didn't need to talk about it.
Dialogue: 0,3:36:54.22,3:36:57.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这是一种相当谨慎的处理方式\NThat I thought was a pretty discreet way of handling something
Dialogue: 0,3:36:57.22,3:37:00.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,勒弗可能并不太愿意谈论这个问题\Nthat Lev probably isn't too excited to talk about,
Dialogue: 0,3:37:00.22,3:37:04.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且坦率地讲 这对他们的最终目标并不那么重要\Nand that frankly, isn't that important to what their end goal is.
Dialogue: 0,3:37:04.66,3:37:07.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,And this is one of the things that I've liked about Naughty Dog's work in the past
Dialogue: 0,3:37:07.95,3:37:12.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,when they have more diverse cast members or characters within their stories,
Dialogue: 0,3:37:12.91,3:37:16.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's usually not the defining point of that character.
Dialogue: 0,3:37:16.30,3:37:19.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,If there's a gay character in the original TLOU,
Dialogue: 0,3:37:19.03,3:37:24.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's there for you to see and you can put it together if you're paying any attention whatsoever.
Dialogue: 0,3:37:24.01,3:37:27.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's not the defining point of that character.

Dialogue: 0,3:37:36.82,3:37:41.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's always a bad thing because people are far more complicated than that,
Dialogue: 0,3:37:41.77,3:37:45.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,and you shouldn't boil yourself down to just one trait.
Dialogue: 0,3:37:45.16,3:37:47.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,You're far more interesting than that.
Dialogue: 0,3:37:47.29,3:37:51.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is why generally, I feel that Naughty Dog's approach to these types of things is good
Dialogue: 0,3:37:51.49,3:37:54.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,because they don't make it the defining characteristic.
Dialogue: 0,3:37:54.40,3:38:01.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, in this most recent gained TLOU2 and in their previous title, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy,
Dialogue: 0,3:38:01.72,3:38:05.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,they fall prey much more to these heavy handed traits
Dialogue: 0,3:38:05.17,3:38:10.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,where they make a character define themselves purely by an external trait.
Dialogue: 0,3:38:10.63,3:38:15.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,And while I have no problem with whatever that trait may be by itself,
Dialogue: 0,3:38:15.70,3:38:18.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think that defining a character that you are crafting
Dialogue: 0,3:38:18.75,3:38:23.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,and putting it into a story by just that one trait is lazy writing.
Dialogue: 0,3:38:23.04,3:38:27.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think it does a disservice to the people who actually share that trait in reality.
Dialogue: 0,3:38:27.91,3:38:32.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, I think it's handled relatively well, if not a little heavy handed.
Dialogue: 0,3:38:32.29,3:38:35.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it doesn't seem to be that crucial of a reveal,

Dialogue: 0,3:42:57.28,3:43:01.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,this spooked me and made me feel as though I was right in the thick of it.
Dialogue: 0,3:43:01.80,3:43:06.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now quick sidebar, remember why Jesse and Ellie separated just a few hours ago
Dialogue: 0,3:43:06.76,3:43:09.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,was because they heard that there was a sniper at the marina,
Dialogue: 0,3:43:09.37,3:43:11.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they assumed that this sniper had to be Tommy.
Dialogue: 0,3:43:11.65,3:43:14.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,So Jesse and Ellie separated.
Dialogue: 0,3:43:14.23,3:43:18.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,So Jesse could go and find Tommie and Ellie could leave and go to the aquarium.

Dialogue: 0,3:43:31.03,3:43:33.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,Well, it was for this very reason.
Dialogue: 0,3:43:33.20,3:43:37.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,They needed to establish that Tommy has sniping experience and is good at what he does.
Dialogue: 0,3:43:37.72,3:43:40.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,And sure enough, who do you think this sniper is?

Dialogue: 0,3:43:43.87,3:43:47.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't think is too important because either way you the way you push up.
Dialogue: 0,3:43:47.05,3:43:49.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I think it's actually probably a cooler moment,
Dialogue: 0,3:43:49.33,3:43:52.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,if you don't realize it's Tommy handling the sniper rifle.
Dialogue: 0,3:43:52.93,3:43:56.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,When you're thinking of it purely as an NPC sniping at you,

Dialogue: 0,3:46:25.93,3:46:31.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is especially bad because Manny just said a few moments ago

Dialogue: 0,3:46:32.68,3:46:38.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,that there's more than one trespassers in town, killing WLF members.
Dialogue: 0,3:46:47.41,3:46:52.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,This means that even if she killed Tommy just now, which is a stretch,

Dialogue: 0,3:58:31.69,3:58:35.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,considering that the Scars got their name "the Scars"
Dialogue: 0,3:58:35.30,3:58:41.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,because they actively and willingly mutilate their mouths with this type of scar intentionally.

Dialogue: 0,4:03:35.02,4:03:37.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,that character being Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,4:03:37.18,4:03:42.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Though based on the pole and the responses that you guys wrote to that survey,
Dialogue: 0,4:03:42.04,4:03:47.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,there is actually a fair number of people that reached this point in the game and refused to continue.
Dialogue: 0,4:03:47.59,4:03:51.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,They'd played 20, 25, 30 hours of this game,
Dialogue: 0,4:03:51.73,4:03:57.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,got to this point and realized that they were being asked to kill Ellie, and they refused to do it.
Dialogue: 0,4:03:57.16,4:03:59.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now at one point, I think that that's a testament
Dialogue: 0,4:03:59.49,4:04:04.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,to just how phenomenally well connected these characters are, to us, the players.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:04.13,4:04:07.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,We care about them, and we don't want to see them mistreated.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:07.24,4:04:10.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now it's really too bad that there wasn't some alternative state
Dialogue: 0,4:04:10.15,4:04:16.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,where you could actually choose not to continue this fight, forgive Ellie, and move on.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:16.14,4:04:19.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,Thing that could have been a cool moment in terms of player agency
Dialogue: 0,4:04:19.17,4:04:21.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,to resolve this dispute peacefully.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:21.76,4:04:25.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,But with a linear narrative game such as this, that doesn't really work too well.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:25.90,4:04:29.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so, you're forced to engage in this boss fight,
Dialogue: 0,4:04:29.30,4:04:32.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,where Abby, the protagonist in this instance,
Dialogue: 0,4:04:32.02,4:04:34.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,is chasing after the antagonist, which is Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:34.74,4:04:36.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's not to say one is right or wrong,
Dialogue: 0,4:04:36.91,4:04:42.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,because protagonist and antagonist are purely based on the perspective of the author.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:42.22,4:04:47.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now as to whether or not this point in the game works, I think there's an active question here.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:47.35,4:04:49.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's probably going to be a little different for everybody.
Dialogue: 0,4:04:49.45,4:04:52.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,Some people probably are going to connect to Abby and Lev
Dialogue: 0,4:04:52.15,4:04:56.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,far more than they connected to Ellie over the course of TLOU2.

Dialogue: 0,4:09:32.35,4:09:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,And when that game came out,
Dialogue: 0,4:09:33.52,4:09:38.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,I couldn't help but feel as though it was either a very conscious decision on the part of Rockstar
Dialogue: 0,4:09:38.77,4:09:42.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,to have this epilogue so clearly separate from the main story,
Dialogue: 0,4:09:42.70,4:09:45.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,or it was a complete and total oversight.

Dialogue: 0,4:09:51.79,4:09:54.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Most players have been going through TLOU2
Dialogue: 0,4:09:54.16,4:09:59.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,with the hope that it will end in a climactic scene between Ellie and Abby,
Dialogue: 0,4:09:59.32,4:10:03.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,where everything gets resolved, preferably where one kills the other,
Dialogue: 0,4:10:03.28,4:10:05.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, there are some sort of reckoning.
Dialogue: 0,4:10:05.56,4:10:10.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I wouldn't say that this scratches that itch or satisfies that demand.
Dialogue: 0,4:10:10.51,4:10:15.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,I don't think it's controversial to say that Abby, pretty clearly won this exchange.

Dialogue: 0,4:10:20.50,4:10:26.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,But out of some sense of dignity or grace and forgiveness, pride,
Dialogue: 0,4:10:26.86,4:10:29.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,whatever it may be, she decided to spare them.
Dialogue: 0,4:10:29.95,4:10:33.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,So while this may be a resolution of the conflict from Abby's perspective,
Dialogue: 0,4:10:33.97,4:10:36.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,she's moving on and wants to forget about all of this.
Dialogue: 0,4:10:36.85,4:10:41.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's not a resolution for Ellie, for Tommy, or for Dina,

Dialogue: 0,4:10:42.97,4:10:47.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think the really frustrating thing for the player is that the entire story has been building
Dialogue: 0,4:10:47.32,4:10:53.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,to this moment, this exchange, this fight, throughout the entirety of the game play time.
Dialogue: 0,4:10:53.50,4:10:57.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,And now that we've reached it, it doesn't resolve itself at all.

Dialogue: 0,4:11:01.51,4:11:04.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,and in the case of Jesse, he's dead.
Dialogue: 0,4:11:04.18,4:11:08.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,And especially considering how emotionally exhausting the scheme is to play,
Dialogue: 0,4:11:08.62,4:11:12.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's really difficult to ask the player to buckle down for another
Dialogue: 0,4:11:12.73,4:11:17.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,however many hours it's going to take to get through what is effectively the epilogue.
Dialogue: 0,4:11:17.32,4:11:22.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I know it's not technically an epilogue because the story hasn't resolved itself.
Dialogue: 0,4:11:22.09,4:11:26.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's still part of the main story as we move into this next chapter.
Dialogue: 0,4:11:26.11,4:11:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,But still it feels as though it separate from the main game.
Dialogue: 0,4:11:29.80,4:11:34.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,And after a lot of contemplation, I am not sure if Naughty Dog wanted this to be the case,
Dialogue: 0,4:11:34.63,4:11:40.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,or if they even meant for this to feel so different from the core body of the game in Seattle.
Dialogue: 0,4:11:40.57,4:11:46.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,It seems to be pretty clear that shifting pace very sharply after all of the events of the core game,
Dialogue: 0,4:11:46.09,4:11:51.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,is going to hit the player in a fairly significant way such that they're going to feel very differently.
Dialogue: 0,4:11:51.52,4:11:53.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's something a good number of developers have spoken of

Dialogue: 0,4:12:18.61,4:12:21.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,but just because you're so focused on the little details,
Dialogue: 0,4:12:21.55,4:12:23.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,you might have lost sight of the overall picture.
Dialogue: 0,4:12:23.92,4:12:29.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or vice versa, you are focused on the broader picture, so you lose sight of the minutiae.
Dialogue: 0,4:12:29.09,4:12:33.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, this final fight leaves the player feeling kind of strange,
Dialogue: 0,4:12:33.09,4:12:34.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least it did for me;
Dialogue: 0,4:12:34.48,4:12:37.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,and based on a lot of your responses to the survey,
Dialogue: 0,4:12:37.12,4:12:40.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,it left a lot of you feeling very strange as well.
Dialogue: 0,4:12:40.15,4:12:41.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I don't know about you,
Dialogue: 0,4:12:41.41,4:12:45.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,but often strangers into feeling I would associate with quality.
Dialogue: 0,4:12:45.97,4:12:50.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,But with all that said after this initial chunk of the game is over,
Dialogue: 0,4:12:50.21,4:12:53.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,the player's left with a lot of questions unresolved.
Dialogue: 0,4:12:53.02,4:12:55.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,For instance, is Dina okay?
Dialogue: 0,4:12:55.45,4:13:00.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,Is she going to survive having her face bashed into cement multiple times?
Dialogue: 0,4:13:00.32,4:13:03.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,While it's technically it wasn't cement, they put down a particle board
Dialogue: 0,4:13:03.99,4:13:07.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,so that they could have an excuse as to why she survived, its good detail.
Dialogue: 0,4:13:07.54,4:13:08.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'm glad that they put this in there
Dialogue: 0,4:13:08.87,4:13:12.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,so that it's not totally unbelievable that she survived a cracked skull.
Dialogue: 0,4:13:12.91,4:13:18.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,But still this is a pretty rough thing to go through, especially when you're pregnant.
Dialogue: 0,4:13:18.49,4:13:21.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,So the player's left wondering whether or not she's going to be okay.
Dialogue: 0,4:13:21.52,4:13:24.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,You also have to ask yourself what's going to happen to this couple

Dialogue: 0,4:13:34.69,4:13:38.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,Can, or will they ever be able to adjust?
Dialogue: 0,4:13:38.35,4:13:40.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean, we don't ever really get to know.
Dialogue: 0,4:13:40.28,4:13:43.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because in the following sequences, we never return back to Jackson.
Dialogue: 0,4:13:43.72,4:13:47.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,And perhaps the most important question is what does Ellie do now?

Dialogue: 0,4:13:54.46,4:13:59.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or are we setting ourselves up for one last hurrah to try and resolve everything
Dialogue: 0,4:13:59.77,4:14:04.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,in a desperate attempt to justify the events of the core game itself,
Dialogue: 0,4:14:04.90,4:14:07.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,just like Red Dead Redemption 2.

Dialogue: 0,4:15:23.05,4:15:26.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, everything seems calm and relatively happy,
Dialogue: 0,4:15:26.80,4:15:30.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,but nothing ever ends happily in this world.
Dialogue: 0,4:15:30.34,4:15:32.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,So of course this won't last for long.
Dialogue: 0,4:15:32.83,4:15:37.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie does some routine chores, you dance with Dina a little bit, and you explore the house.

Dialogue: 0,4:15:43.81,4:15:44.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a nice touch,
Dialogue: 0,4:15:44.74,4:15:47.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it makes sense since she would likely want to hold on to parts of him,
Dialogue: 0,4:15:47.89,4:15:50.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,as we just saw earlier when she had his watch.
Dialogue: 0,4:15:50.32,4:15:52.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's just a really sweet little detail,
Dialogue: 0,4:15:52.27,4:15:56.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially considering the fact that the player will likely not notice this,
Dialogue: 0,4:15:56.38,4:15:58.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,at least on their first run through the game.
Dialogue: 0,4:15:58.36,4:16:03.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,I only noticed it once I spent a lot of time recording footage for this video
Dialogue: 0,4:16:03.22,4:16:05.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,going back through environments very carefully.
Dialogue: 0,4:16:05.80,4:16:10.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,I noticed that in Joel's house there are a lot of really nice looking paintings that I liked.

Dialogue: 0,4:16:13.99,4:16:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,But then when I went back through this section, I noticed that those paintings looked similar.
Dialogue: 0,4:16:18.59,4:16:23.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I initially thought that they were just reusing assets which is pretty common in game development.
Dialogue: 0,4:16:23.11,4:16:26.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,But upon further inspection and deliberation,
Dialogue: 0,4:16:26.14,4:16:28.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,I realized that this was actually an artistic choice,
Dialogue: 0,4:16:28.87,4:16:34.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,because Ellie is trying to keep and bring parts of Joel into her life even still.
Dialogue: 0,4:16:34.00,4:16:36.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now, after exploring the house and chilling with Dina for a little bit,

Dialogue: 0,4:16:46.60,4:16:50.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,And there's probably leads to the fastest mood shift of the whole game.
Dialogue: 0,4:17:46.48,4:17:50.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,I really think that this moment is meant to hit the player just as hard as it hits Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,4:17:50.41,4:17:52.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,Everything seems fine, calm and relaxed.
Dialogue: 0,4:17:52.54,4:17:56.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,It seems as though they've moved on from a lot of the struggles of the core game

Dialogue: 0,4:17:59.86,4:18:02.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,But now everything is falling apart.

Dialogue: 0,4:18:09.10,4:18:14.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,Dina knows this and is understanding because she knows that Ellie can't help this.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:14.17,4:18:16.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's something beyond her control,
Dialogue: 0,4:18:16.18,4:18:20.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,just like anybody else who suffers from panic attacks can't really control it.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:20.32,4:18:22.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,It just happens when it happens.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:22.36,4:18:24.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the game keeps carrying along, relatively quickly.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:24.94,4:18:28.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,We jump to the next day and there is a guest in the house.

Dialogue: 0,4:18:37.15,4:18:41.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean, he took a bullet to the head, so … it's understandable.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:41.41,4:18:42.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,Clearly he's not in good shape,
Dialogue: 0,4:18:42.94,4:18:46.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,but he does not want to let Abby get away with what she's done.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:46.75,4:18:49.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,He says that he's tractor to a location in Santa Barbara.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:49.93,4:18:51.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now, even though he doesn't state it outright,
Dialogue: 0,4:18:51.85,4:18:54.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's pretty clear that he's unable to go and chase her himself.
Dialogue: 0,4:18:54.97,4:18:58.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,He can barely walk after all, and he's missing an eye now,
Dialogue: 0,4:18:58.09,4:19:01.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,so he wouldn't exactly be much help if he were to go.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:01.51,4:19:06.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so he's come to Ellie to proposition her for this revenge plot.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:06.16,4:19:08.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now initially, this might seem relatively far fetched
Dialogue: 0,4:19:08.69,4:19:14.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,that Tommy was able to track her down to a city that is very far away from where they are at.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:14.65,4:19:18.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,Apparently they're just outside of Jackson in the surrounding area,
Dialogue: 0,4:19:18.67,4:19:22.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,so they're local, but they have moved out away from the core group.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:22.99,4:19:26.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, I don't think this is as far as stretch as it might initially seem.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:26.56,4:19:29.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,Tommy has a ton of connections to the Fireflies.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:29.29,4:19:30.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you remember from earlier,
Dialogue: 0,4:19:30.58,4:19:36.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Owen said that he wanted to go to Santa Barbara on the boat with Mel, Abby, Yara and Lev,
Dialogue: 0,4:19:36.85,4:19:40.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,because he thought that there were going to be a lot of Fireflies there
Dialogue: 0,4:19:40.36,4:19:42.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they could connect and join up with.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:42.57,4:19:46.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,Using the same contacts, it seems Tommy was able to track
Dialogue: 0,4:19:46.28,4:19:54.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,a very buff woman with a small young Asian individual by her side to this area.
Dialogue: 0,4:19:54.67,4:19:59.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,So it seems relatively plausible that they would be able to track her to this point,
Dialogue: 0,4:19:59.14,4:20:05.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially if Tommy were to put out an APB on this individual trying to find her,
Dialogue: 0,4:20:05.05,4:20:06.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,which he's clearly done.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:06.25,4:20:11.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, after hearing his proposition, Ellie and Dina strongly reject the idea.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:11.95,4:20:13.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,They are done with that.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:13.03,4:20:16.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or at the very least, Dina is, and Ellie going along with it.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:16.36,4:20:18.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now they have too much to lose.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:18.73,4:20:22.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,They have a house of family and of course each other.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:22.49,4:20:24.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,They've been there, done that.

Dialogue: 0,4:20:30.91,4:20:33.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,He feels betrayed, and even calls Ellie out,
Dialogue: 0,4:20:33.75,4:20:37.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,since she told him that she was going to do whatever it took to get revenge.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:37.99,4:20:43.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's an understandable reaction, considering that Tommy is still furious about his brother's death,
Dialogue: 0,4:20:43.03,4:20:46.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that she has now permanently scarred him.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:46.48,4:20:52.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it is a little startling to see Tommy react in such a sharp way towards Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,4:20:52.15,4:20:55.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,In fact, I can't think of a time when we've ever seen Tommy
Dialogue: 0,4:20:55.55,4:21:01.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,react or talk to somebody in this way throughout the entirety of this franchise.
Dialogue: 0,4:21:01.12,4:21:06.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,The closest example would be in the first game when Joel and Tommy got frustrated with each other

Dialogue: 0,4:21:08.80,4:21:12.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,But even that wasn't this sharp or direct.

Dialogue: 0,4:21:19.81,4:21:22.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,But Ellie is still caught up in all of this.

Dialogue: 0,4:21:47.74,4:21:50.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,In fact, it seems to make everything worse.
Dialogue: 0,4:21:50.32,4:21:53.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,We then jumped to the scene of the Jackson Winter Ball

Dialogue: 0,4:22:17.62,4:22:23.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,Likely because she feels as though Joel is once again keeping her from fighting her own fights.
Dialogue: 0,4:22:23.23,4:22:25.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, we'll talk about this more in just a little bit.

Dialogue: 0,4:25:14.35,4:25:20.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,To so clearly show these shoes to me is hitting the player over the head with this simile.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:20.92,4:25:23.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now Abby and Lev are looking for the Fireflies
Dialogue: 0,4:25:23.16,4:25:25.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,hoping to find a new home to which they can belong.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:25.56,4:25:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, remembering that Owen suggested Santa Barbara way back when.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:29.80,4:25:33.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now they had a tip that 2425 Constance in Santa Barbara
Dialogue: 0,4:25:33.93,4:25:36.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,was a hideout for the underground Firefly network.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:36.97,4:25:40.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so after Abby and Lev fight through a few infected,
Dialogue: 0,4:25:40.87,4:25:42.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,they worked their way to the basement of the house,
Dialogue: 0,4:25:42.88,4:25:44.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,and the pair discovers a radio.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:44.92,4:25:47.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,And after a few attempts they connect with somebody.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:47.59,4:25:52.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it seems as though Abby and Lev have found their new home and will be safe after all.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:52.69,4:25:55.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,But again, no, everything is sad and terrible.
Dialogue: 0,4:25:55.78,4:26:01.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,Nothing's gonna end happily, so just get ready, everything is going to go terribly wrong.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:01.45,4:26:05.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,So the two set up a meet up point where they're gonna head to meet up with the Fireflies.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:05.47,4:26:06.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,As the pair leaves the house,
Dialogue: 0,4:26:06.70,4:26:10.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,they are intercepted by a small gang as they exit out the front of the house.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:10.78,4:26:13.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,It seems that these people are involved in the slave trade,
Dialogue: 0,4:26:13.57,4:26:17.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,which, to be honest, I'm stunned took this long to be featured in the game.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:17.50,4:26:20.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,They're beaten, tied up and taken away,
Dialogue: 0,4:26:20.17,4:26:25.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,presumably to be entered into the slave trade and used for manual labor.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:25.39,4:26:27.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,We then cut to Ellie, who was closing in quickly.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:27.88,4:26:30.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's found their boat and begins pushing into their location
Dialogue: 0,4:26:30.72,4:26:34.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,after finding a map that has 2425 Constance marked on it.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:34.15,4:26:36.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,As you push through multiple houses and streets,
Dialogue: 0,4:26:36.94,4:26:40.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,this is the last zombie hurrah combat in the entire game.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:40.24,4:26:41.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,So be sure to enjoy it.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:41.36,4:26:45.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because after this Naughty Dog is going to be sticking with human enemies exclusively.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:45.46,4:26:49.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,Except for one small exception, which I'll point out in a moment.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:49.09,4:26:52.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,But still, it's going to be pretty much all humans after this.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:52.03,4:26:55.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie pushes her way through an initial neighborhood and starts climbing down a hill.
Dialogue: 0,4:26:55.84,4:26:56.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,When this happens.
Dialogue: 0,4:28:59.56,4:29:02.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now these guys are obviously super dome.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:02.17,4:29:07.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,But you have to ask yourself as the player, what's keeping you going?
Dialogue: 0,4:29:07.16,4:29:12.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,Other than just going through the motions of continuing to do what the game asks you to do.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:12.22,4:29:17.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,One of the best things about the early hours of TLOU2 is that the player is completely on board
Dialogue: 0,4:29:17.04,4:29:21.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,with Ellie's drive and mission to take out Abby.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:21.34,4:29:22.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,And as the game goes on,
Dialogue: 0,4:29:22.54,4:29:28.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,you also start to lose that motivation once you start to sympathise with Abby and her crew.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:28.06,4:29:31.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,So you end up very conflicted in that final boss fight
Dialogue: 0,4:29:31.15,4:29:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,where you don't want to do anything or hurt either one of these characters.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:34.66,4:29:37.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,But now the players still feels like that.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:37.48,4:29:41.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,And yet the game designers are asking Ellie to chase down Abby,
Dialogue: 0,4:29:41.44,4:29:44.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,even though it's caused her to lose everything at this point
Dialogue: 0,4:29:44.68,4:29:48.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,and will likely not result in the conclusion
Dialogue: 0,4:29:48.46,4:29:51.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,that either the player or Ellie he would be satisfied with.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:51.64,4:29:53.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,Some people have said that this is a pacing issue,
Dialogue: 0,4:29:53.83,4:29:56.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I don't think that that's the right way to phrase it.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:56.44,4:29:59.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,If anything, I think that this is a motivational issue.
Dialogue: 0,4:29:59.17,4:30:03.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think the player doesn't feel motivated to continue on this mission
Dialogue: 0,4:30:03.24,4:30:05.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they're being asked to embark on.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:05.59,4:30:07.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now of course, you could have a game
Dialogue: 0,4:30:07.07,4:30:11.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,that motivates the player to continue playing purely by way of its game play,
Dialogue: 0,4:30:11.14,4:30:14.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,and there is no narrative reason to continue at all.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:14.32,4:30:17.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, that's not how Naughty Dog games work.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:17.29,4:30:23.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,Naughty Dog games are entirely about motivating the player by way of this narrative drive.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:23.77,4:30:27.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I'll be honest, it's really too bad that this falls so flat
Dialogue: 0,4:30:27.32,4:30:29.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,because this should be the climax of the game.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:29.62,4:30:32.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,But instead it feels as though it's a total chore,
Dialogue: 0,4:30:32.95,4:30:37.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,because the player doesn't feel as though Ellie is justified in what she's doing.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:37.09,4:30:40.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,And certainly Ellie is even frustrated with her own decision.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:40.81,4:30:45.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,The only reason Ellie is continuing on it is because she feels an obligation to Joel,
Dialogue: 0,4:30:45.49,4:30:48.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,an obligation that's going to be resolved very shortly.
Dialogue: 0,4:30:48.73,4:30:54.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,But even so, the player pushes on into the slave trader camped known as "the Resort".
Dialogue: 0,4:30:54.46,4:30:56.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's not a sassy or funny name,
Dialogue: 0,4:30:56.44,4:31:00.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's just that it's an old resort, so they call it "the Resort".
Dialogue: 0,4:31:00.67,4:31:05.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's pretty simple now this section does feature my favorite gun of the entire game,
Dialogue: 0,4:31:05.44,4:31:10.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,but it's so damn powerful that it removes any need for any finesse whatsoever.
Dialogue: 0,4:31:10.99,4:31:12.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,So with this new found super weapon,
Dialogue: 0,4:31:12.97,4:31:17.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,you fight your way through the Resorts main building where all of the slaves are housed.
Dialogue: 0,4:31:17.62,4:31:20.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, the section is actually pretty bad,
Dialogue: 0,4:31:20.23,4:31:24.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,especially when considering that it is the final section of the game.
Dialogue: 0,4:31:24.55,4:31:30.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,This is the final game play section of the game other than the final boss quote-unquote, "fight",
Dialogue: 0,4:31:30.76,4:31:33.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,and its painfully uninteresting.
Dialogue: 0,4:31:33.10,4:31:35.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,The only thing that shakes it up a little bit
Dialogue: 0,4:31:35.32,4:31:40.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,is having zombies chained up that you can release on the human NPCs.
Dialogue: 0,4:31:40.36,4:31:43.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,But other than that, there's really nothing that's interesting about this level.
Dialogue: 0,4:31:43.57,4:31:47.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,And even though zombies, you shoot off their chains or disconnect them,
Dialogue: 0,4:31:47.17,4:31:50.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they started attacking the other people, the other NPCs
Dialogue: 0,4:31:50.48,4:31:53.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,and then you just end up having to kill zombies before they come to you
Dialogue: 0,4:31:53.56,4:31:56.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,if they are not already killed by those human NPCs.
Dialogue: 0,4:31:56.77,4:32:00.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,So it even by itself doesn't do anything new or different.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:00.61,4:32:06.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's just bland and it's unfortunate because it really should be the climax,
Dialogue: 0,4:32:06.31,4:32:09.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,but instead it just lands super flat.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:09.28,4:32:10.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,I was really surprised to see this
Dialogue: 0,4:32:10.82,4:32:14.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,because usually Naughty Dog is pretty good about sticking the landing.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:14.05,4:32:18.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,They go crazy, big and elaborate in the final sections of the game,
Dialogue: 0,4:32:18.31,4:32:21.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,whether you're looking at Uncharted or even the original TLOU game
Dialogue: 0,4:32:21.88,4:32:25.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,where they really push the boundary of difficulty.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:25.27,4:32:27.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,But here it just doesn't work.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:27.64,4:32:32.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,But even so, after killing countless slavers, Ellie finds her way to the beach.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:32.17,4:32:34.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's told by several other prisoners
Dialogue: 0,4:32:34.04,4:32:38.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,that this is where Abby and Lev have been moved after they tried to escape.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:38.26,4:32:41.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,And usually the slaves are left here hung up until they die.
Dialogue: 0,4:32:41.74,4:32:44.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I gotta say it's pretty surreal once you reach this beach
Dialogue: 0,4:32:44.96,4:32:47.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,and what Ellie finds there is pretty upsetting.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:08.20,4:33:12.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now there's actually a fake out with the girl in the center that has the braid.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:12.55,4:33:16.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,It looks like Abby, especially Abby the last time that we saw her.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:16.42,4:33:18.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's not Abby.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:18.60,4:33:21.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby in fact, you just walked past.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:21.81,4:33:24.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,And she's in much worse shape.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:39.17,4:33:42.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,Truely, she doesn't even look like the same person.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:42.46,4:33:46.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now it took a moment that Abby recognizes Ellie here,
Dialogue: 0,4:33:46.06,4:33:48.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,but she's not interested in fighting.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:48.37,4:33:52.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,Instead, the moment that Ellie cuts her down, she goes to help Lev.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:52.66,4:33:56.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby then carries Lev into the distance despite her weakness.
Dialogue: 0,4:33:56.68,4:33:58.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,And they come up on the same boat
Dialogue: 0,4:33:58.55,4:34:02.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,that we've seen in the title screen every time we booted up the game to this point.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:02.95,4:34:07.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,Even now, Abby is purely concerned with taking care of Lev,
Dialogue: 0,4:34:07.06,4:34:09.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,making sure that they are able to get out safely.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:09.94,4:34:13.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,She even leads Ellie to the boats to help her escape.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:13.33,4:34:16.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,I'm aware that Ellie has come to kill her
Dialogue: 0,4:34:16.84,4:34:20.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,and enact the revenge that she sought out initially.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:20.32,4:34:25.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,As far as we know, Abby may think that Ellie was being housed as a slave herself,
Dialogue: 0,4:34:25.39,4:34:27.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,and has escaped to this point.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:27.34,4:34:29.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,But whatever it may be,
Dialogue: 0,4:34:29.08,4:34:31.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby gets down to the boat area
Dialogue: 0,4:34:31.52,4:34:36.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,and Ellie still wounded from the tree branch that she was impaled with,
Dialogue: 0,4:34:36.04,4:34:40.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,and Abby, wounded from the weeks or months of torture,
Dialogue: 0,4:34:40.41,4:34:46.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,at their very end, have to face off in one final painful battle.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:46.27,4:34:50.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie demands to fight with Abbey to finish this once and for all.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:50.31,4:34:55.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,She even takes out her switch blade and threatens to kill Lev if Abby doesn't engage with her.
Dialogue: 0,4:34:55.48,4:34:57.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so left with no choice,
Dialogue: 0,4:34:57.79,4:35:03.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,Abby decides that she'll fight Ellie, not for her, not for Ellie, but for Lev.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:03.67,4:35:07.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you show to player this fight scene at the very start of the game,
Dialogue: 0,4:35:07.90,4:35:10.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,it would probably give them a lot of pleasure.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:10.45,4:35:16.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,It would feel good for the player to literally hack and slash the person that killed Joel to pieces.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:16.66,4:35:19.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,But instead, it's absolutely horrible.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:19.63,4:35:20.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's pathetic.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:20.95,4:35:25.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,And no part of this feels like a comeuppance or like justice.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:25.06,4:35:29.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think if anything, this means that the game's arc worked.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:29.50,4:35:33.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,It actually went from me wanting to kill Joel's killer
Dialogue: 0,4:35:33.67,4:35:36.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,to wanting to forgive her and move on.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:36.43,4:35:38.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's simple, but it's powerful.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:38.74,4:35:44.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,And as this fight continued on, all I could ask for was that they would just stop.
Dialogue: 0,4:35:44.83,4:35:46.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the fight continues,
Dialogue: 0,4:35:46.78,4:35:51.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,each growing weaker and weaker until the fight comes to its inevitable conclusion.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:10.57,4:38:12.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,We're now back at the farm house.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:12.52,4:38:17.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,It seems to have been quite a while, since everything is so dilapidated.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:17.02,4:38:21.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,That house's empty, the paint chipping, the woods warped,
Dialogue: 0,4:38:21.50,4:38:24.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I think all of this is meant to show that Dina moved out with the baby
Dialogue: 0,4:38:24.72,4:38:26.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that Ellie is now alone.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:26.50,4:38:30.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,But regardless, it's been quite a while since anyone's been here.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:30.10,4:38:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so while it may be meant to show that Ellie is alone
Dialogue: 0,4:38:33.87,4:38:36.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that the ramifications for her actions
Dialogue: 0,4:38:36.86,4:38:40.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,have taken much more of a toll than just the loss of a couple fingers.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:40.96,4:38:42.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think it might not be that simple,
Dialogue: 0,4:38:42.76,4:38:46.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,and this might actually be a happier ending than it might initially seem to be.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:46.78,4:38:48.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,But we'll get to that in just a few minutes.
Dialogue: 0,4:38:48.82,4:38:50.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie walks through the empty house,
Dialogue: 0,4:38:50.65,4:38:55.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,eventually coming into one room that has what seems to be most of Ellie's old things,
Dialogue: 0,4:38:55.30,4:38:58.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,and a lot of Joel's items that were collected throughout the house.

Dialogue: 0,4:39:00.52,4:39:06.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,and plays a strained version of the song that he played for her in the beginning.
Dialogue: 0,4:39:06.04,4:39:12.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,Her missing fingers, now a permanent example of the distance between Joel and Ellie
Dialogue: 0,4:39:12.16,4:39:14.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,and their inability to truly connect,
Dialogue: 0,4:39:14.84,4:39:18.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,she can't even play the song properly or fully now.

Dialogue: 0,4:46:18.37,4:46:19.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it seems as though,

Dialogue: 0,4:47:34.39,4:47:37.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because I think that this game is truly exceptional,
Dialogue: 0,4:47:37.85,4:47:41.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,again in the purest sense of the word, where it's an exception to the rule.
Dialogue: 0,4:47:41.83,4:47:43.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,Most games, you can give a thumbs up or thumbs down,
Dialogue: 0,4:47:43.93,4:47:45.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,you can say it's really good or it's really bad.
Dialogue: 0,4:47:45.70,4:47:49.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,And TLOU2 is a game I think is very, very good.

Dialogue: 0,4:47:52.45,4:47:56.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,For the most part, it works really well, except for some pacing issues.
Dialogue: 0,4:47:56.53,4:48:02.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,But a lot of those pacing issues are problematic, primarily because of the narrative
Dialogue: 0,4:48:02.61,4:48:07.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,because you want to focus on one character and you're having to keep swap between the two.
Dialogue: 0,4:48:07.12,4:48:09.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,But even so, there's some gameplay pacing issues,
Dialogue: 0,4:48:09.46,4:48:14.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,such as having problems with climax building
Dialogue: 0,4:48:14.39,4:48:19.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,and making sure that the final boss fights are really intriguing and interesting, and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,4:48:19.87,4:48:25.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,But all told, as far as the game is concerned, it's very well done as a game,
Dialogue: 0,4:48:25.37,4:48:28.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,and most people who have a problem with TLOU2
Dialogue: 0,4:48:28.63,4:48:31.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,don't deny that they accepted and agree with it.
Dialogue: 0,4:48:31.24,4:48:35.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,So that doesn't seem to be where the criticisms tend to come out.
Dialogue: 0,4:48:35.98,4:48:39.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think we're most criticisms find themselves presented …
Dialogue: 0,4:48:40.51,4:48:44.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,our with regards to the direction Naughty Dog chose to go in.
Dialogue: 0,4:48:45.19,4:48:47.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because the writers, of course, had the option,
Dialogue: 0,4:48:47.80,4:48:50.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,they didn't have to go the direction that they did.
Dialogue: 0,4:48:50.35,4:48:52.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,They didn't have to kill Joel off for one,
Dialogue: 0,4:48:52.36,4:48:55.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,they didn't have to make you empathize with Abby,
Dialogue: 0,4:48:55.93,4:49:00.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,they didn't have to make you play as Abby for the second half of the game,
Dialogue: 0,4:49:00.70,4:49:02.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,they didn't have to do any of that.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:02.17,4:49:04.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,But that's the direction they chose to go in.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:04.03,4:49:06.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think as far as I can tell,
Dialogue: 0,4:49:06.25,4:49:13.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,most people were hoping and expecting that the game would be about Ellie,
Dialogue: 0,4:49:13.15,4:49:14.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that's it.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:14.56,4:49:19.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,They were interested in playing and getting to know this new character.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:20.20,4:49:23.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think that that's just the frustrating thing about it
Dialogue: 0,4:49:23.76,4:49:26.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,is that a lot of people were hoping and expecting to
Dialogue: 0,4:49:26.96,4:49:29.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,have exposure and experience with Ellie.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:29.44,4:49:34.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,That was not just dreadful through and through,
Dialogue: 0,4:49:34.03,4:49:37.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,But instead they were forced to go through this very frustrating and
Dialogue: 0,4:49:37.97,4:49:41.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,very emotionally taxing journey with her,
Dialogue: 0,4:49:41.35,4:49:43.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,which I think is probably where I land.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:43.75,4:49:48.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because I really cherish Ellie as a character, I care about her,
Dialogue: 0,4:49:48.97,4:49:50.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I connected with her on a level
Dialogue: 0,4:49:50.64,4:49:53.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,I didn't realize I could connect with the character in the first game.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:53.74,4:49:58.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,And her actions in the second game make her very difficult to sympathize with.
Dialogue: 0,4:49:58.66,4:50:02.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because she's doing things that are objectively pretty dumb and stupid
Dialogue: 0,4:50:02.04,4:50:05.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,that aren't for the betterment of her and the people around her.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:05.95,4:50:08.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's being fairly selfish in what she's doing,
Dialogue: 0,4:50:08.47,4:50:14.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,and she does feel a an obligation of sorts to Joel to continue on in her revenge journey.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:14.98,4:50:20.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,But still, it's not the same as the actions of Joel in the first game
Dialogue: 0,4:50:20.59,4:50:25.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,where he goes after Ellie, even though he's killing a lot of people to get to her and to save her
Dialogue: 0,4:50:25.72,4:50:29.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,from the Fireflies and everything they are about to do to her.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:29.28,4:50:32.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,At least there you can understand why he's doing it and you might even agreed
Dialogue: 0,4:50:32.70,4:50:34.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,because you care about Ellie too.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:34.27,4:50:36.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,And you might say I care about her so much,
Dialogue: 0,4:50:36.49,4:50:39.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,I would probably do the same thing if I was in his shoes.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:39.39,4:50:44.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,With Ellie in this game, many times, I found myself saying I would not have done that.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:44.83,4:50:47.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,That was the wrong choice, I don't agree with that.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:47.44,4:50:50.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,I care about you Ellie, and that's why I disagree with what you're doing.
Dialogue: 0,4:50:50.53,4:50:55.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's on a self destructive, borderline suicide mission throughout the entire game,
Dialogue: 0,4:50:55.93,4:50:59.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that just makes it so hard to sympathize with her, if not impossible.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:00.40,4:51:02.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,And when you don't sympathise with somebody,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:02.95,4:51:05.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,you shouldn't be surprised when people don't connect with them,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:05.53,4:51:07.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why, for a lot of people,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:07.33,4:51:12.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,they found themselves feeling as though that this wasn't a TLOU game, even by itself.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:12.76,4:51:16.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,It wasn't a sequel, it was a completely separate story.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:16.63,4:51:18.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie had grown up and become a different person,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:18.85,4:51:23.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,and she was almost unrecognisable from the character she was in the first game,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:23.50,4:51:27.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why Naughty Dog keep springing up all these flashbacks
Dialogue: 0,4:51:27.04,4:51:30.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,to kind of remind you of what Ellie used to be like.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:31.30,4:51:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,But that isn't enough, because you're playing in the current timeline.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:34.66,4:51:39.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,And if that Ellie is not enjoyable, isn't sympathetic, and you don't care about her,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:39.55,4:51:41.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,you don't care about her.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:41.08,4:51:43.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,So when we bring up the question,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:43.51,4:51:47.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,whether or not Ellie is is a well written character in this story.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:47.86,4:51:50.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think for the story they were trying to tell she was well written,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:50.95,4:51:53.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it accomplish the purpose which for Naughty Dog
Dialogue: 0,4:51:53.94,4:52:00.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,was to make you sympathize with somebody that killed a character you loved and cared about,
Dialogue: 0,4:52:00.00,4:52:03.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,to make you see the other side of the story,
Dialogue: 0,4:52:03.58,4:52:08.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,to understand all the perspectives, and to get that sometimes violence isn't the answer.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:08.92,4:52:14.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,And sometimes, terrible things happen and are somewhat justified.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:14.38,4:52:18.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or that you could even find yourself in the shoes of that character doing that thing
Dialogue: 0,4:52:19.16,4:52:23.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,if you were put into some sort of like different circumstances, you know.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:23.17,4:52:27.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think that that's a really interesting story to tell.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:27.76,4:52:29.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think that's a fair story to tell.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:29.29,4:52:31.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,And that's … when I think of the game that way,
Dialogue: 0,4:52:31.84,4:52:36.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,I find myself much more impressed with it and thinking that it's absolutely a masterpiece.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:37.42,4:52:40.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I think my frustration is that it was a TLOU game.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:41.48,4:52:49.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,And that they sacrifice not just Joel but also Ellie at the altar of that story.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:49.09,4:52:53.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because I don't think that creating new characters
Dialogue: 0,4:52:53.29,4:52:58.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,and telling the story from start to finish with new characters would have been as successful.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:58.24,4:53:05.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think part of what makes that story arc of "Forgiving the Unforgivable", the title of this video.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:06.13,4:53:10.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think that's part of what of what makes it so impressive is that
Dialogue: 0,4:53:10.93,4:53:16.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,you are dealing with characters you've known effectively for a decade at this point.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:16.35,4:53:18.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,You've known for seven plus years,
Dialogue: 0,4:53:18.58,4:53:21.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,by the time you're watching this magnum for … for longer than that.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:22.45,4:53:27.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think that that's just what's really frustrating, but understandable is that
Dialogue: 0,4:53:27.95,4:53:33.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,they sacrifice these two characters that you love for the sake of telling this story,
Dialogue: 0,4:53:33.34,4:53:37.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,when they reassured us prior to launch that they were doing
Dialogue: 0,4:53:37.05,4:53:40.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,what was best for the characters that they weren't going to do them dirty,
Dialogue: 0,4:53:40.84,4:53:44.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,that this was what was best for Joel and Ellie,
Dialogue: 0,4:53:44.08,4:53:48.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they wouldn't be making the game if they didn't feel as though it was the right story to tell.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:49.72,4:53:53.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,So I can understand the frustration on that end.

Dialogue: 0,4:54:23.02,4:54:29.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's something I didn't really consider until a good number of people had tweeted it at me

Dialogue: 0,4:54:35.02,4:54:38.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's something that once I started to investigate it, I was kind of blown away,
