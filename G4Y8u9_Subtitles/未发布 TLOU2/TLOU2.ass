Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.09,0:01:17.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,So TLOU2 opens with Joel, discussing the ending events of the first game.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.58,0:01:20.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,The cameras focused on the threat board of the guitar,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.34,0:01:23.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,which has a very distinctive symbol on it, which will be important later.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.91,0:01:27.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,I want you to take a mental picture of this scene
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.25,0:01:30.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,because it's going to come back all the way at the end of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.60,0:01:33.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,During this conversation between Joel and Tommy,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.81,0:01:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel explains his decision to save Ellie over humanity.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.37,0:01:43.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now even this point was one of controversy when the game first launched.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.86,0:01:45.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,You see, at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.42,0:01:50.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,there was a serious question as to whether or not the Fireflies would be able to develop a vaccine at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.91,0:01:55.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,It was one of the reasons that a lot of people thought that Joel's actions were highly justified.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.32,0:01:58.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,Not just in that he was saving Ellie, his "daughter character",
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.89,0:02:02.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,but rather that he didn't want to sacrifice Ellie's life
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.78,0:02:07.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,for the sake of a cause which likely wouldn't find success any ways.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.14,0:02:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, the fireflies in the first game are pretty damn in competent.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.52,0:02:14.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,They hire somebody from outside their ranks to transport,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.67,0:02:19.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,who is likely the most important human being who has ever lived in the form of Ellie
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.29,0:02:24.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,all the way across the country in order to hopefully develop a vaccine.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.21,0:02:28.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,But when you get there and you explore the hospital at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.38,0:02:34.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,you find out that a lot of the doctors involved in this procedure are unsure as to whether or not it's even possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:34.68,0:02:39.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, literally, every single person in this hospital
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.35,0:02:46.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,is completely inexperienced in developing a vaccine for a fungus such as this.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.29,0:02:49.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the fireflies argument is that at least there's a chance.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.73,0:02:54.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,If Ellie runs off, and they don't even attempt to extract any of the antibodies
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.01,0:02:59.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,or whatever the hell his inside of her brain that allows her to survive after having a bite.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.25,0:03:02.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,Then they will never know whether or not a vaccine is possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.88,0:03:07.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,But if they crack her skull open and try and develop some sort of vaccine at the very least,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.62,0:03:09.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,then there's a chance.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.15,0:03:11.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, in the opening for this sequel,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.97,0:03:14.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,We see that Joel is pretty confident
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.39,0:03:18.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they were trying to develop a vaccine and that they likely would have been able to,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.60,0:03:19.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,but that it would have killed her.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.95,0:03:24.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it's Tommy's expression that I think sets the tone
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.44,0:03:27.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,for how the player is supposed to feel about joel's decision.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.87,0:03:33.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,He's stunned, but at the same time he can't really blame Joel for the choice that he made.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.45,0:03:36.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, later on, in this very intro sequence,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.96,0:03:40.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,Tommy turns to Joel and tells him that he would have done the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.56,0:03:46.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, the choice to open the game in this way is very, very important.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.14,0:03:50.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,The writers over at naughty dog wanted to remind the player of what Joel had done
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.55,0:03:56.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,and establish that as the fulcrum from which every narrative mechanism will hinge.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.04,0:04:01.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,After this conversation, Tommy still unsure of how to react,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.26,0:04:05.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,simply tells Joel to hop on his horse and head back into town.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.31,0:04:08.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,It buys Tommy some time in order to form an opinion,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.40,0:04:12.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it also gives the player a chance to settle back into this world.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.93,0:04:15.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's really common for sequels to rush into things,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.54,0:04:19.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,Giving the player a chance to see something new and fresh and different
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.05,0:04:21.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,that they only could have dreamed of in the first game.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.87,0:04:25.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, and thankfully naughty dog doesn't do this.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.35,0:04:28.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,They take their time during this intro to set things up,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.29,0:04:30.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I think it works very, very well.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.66,0:04:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,You ride through a beautiful landscape and come up on Jackson,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.87,0:04:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's at this time that we get our first look at a fully realized Jackson,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.37,0:04:42.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,the city that we saw peak of at the end of the first game, but that we could only imagine.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.85,0:04:44.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I've got to hand it to naughty dog.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.67,0:04:51.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,This opening sequence has one of the most well realized cities I've ever seen in any video game ever.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.57,0:04:53.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,It truly is fantastic.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.52,0:05:01.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,Every NPC, every animation, every building, every step in the snow is detailed and realistic.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.62,0:05:03.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,As far as immersion is concerned,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.48,0:05:08.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think this is one of the most fantastically effective games that's ever been created.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.60,0:05:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,After you reach the inside of the city,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.53,0:05:16.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,Tommy and Joel hop off of their horses and Tommy offers to stow Joel's horse for him,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.26,0:05:19.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,while also saying that he'll take the truth to his grave.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.35,0:05:21.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,This implies a couple of things.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.06,0:05:24.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,For one, it might seem as though he's referring directly to Ellie
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.20,0:05:28.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,that if Ellie were to find out this truth, it would cause a lot of problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.74,0:05:31.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,After all, as far as Ellie is concerned,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.08,0:05:35.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel simply took Ellie after a bunch of tests were run,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.40,0:05:40.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it was clear that she was not going to be able to provide any sort of help towards a vaccine at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.77,0:05:42.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,At the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.03,0:05:45.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's pretty clear that Ellie sees through this lie, that Joel is telling,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.54,0:05:48.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, she expects that there's more to this story.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.84,0:05:52.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,For the sake of their relationship, she simply goes along with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.14,0:05:54.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,However, I think there's another implication to this as well,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.78,0:05:59.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that is that if other people in the camp were to find out what Joel had done,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.19,0:06:01.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,I am not so sure that they would approve of it either.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.62,0:06:06.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, we can talk all day about how incompetent the fireflies were in the first game.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.21,0:06:08.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think there's a real argument to be had there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.31,0:06:11.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,I mean, if I had to entrust them with the fate of humanity,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.46,0:06:14.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,I would hop on the next asteroid off the planet.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.28,0:06:18.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,What I mean, though, is that naughty dog is trying to tell his story,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.24,0:06:22.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they're framing the plot points the way that they want you the player to see them.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.47,0:06:24.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,For the sake of this story,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.15,0:06:28.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's important to understand that the fireflies were the ones that were trying to save humanity
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.84,0:06:36.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,and were apparently on the cusp of developing a vaccine to save countless millions of lives.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.06,0:06:40.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,And once again, for the sake of this story, that's been told in TLOU2,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.84,0:06:43.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel is the one that undid that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.52,0:06:49.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,Again, at the very least, if Ellie had gone under the knife, there would have been a chance for a vaccine.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.68,0:06:55.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,By killing the doctors that were about to operate on Ellie and potentially develop a vaccine,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.71,0:06:58.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,he effectively saved his "daughter figure",
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.23,0:07:02.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,but he damned all of humanity for the rest of time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.67,0:07:06.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,In other words, he strained at a gnat but swallowed a camel.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.39,0:07:11.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,He traded what seemed to be a smaller evil for a much much larger evil,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.31,0:07:17.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,and he did this because his judgment was clouded by his own personal wants and wishes.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.10,0:07:23.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,This isn't to say that Joel would or does regret any of this in this particular sequence.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.13,0:07:26.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,But it is to say that the players should start seriously considering
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.44,0:07:32.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,whether or not Joel's actions were justified, or perhaps even whether or not they were right.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.31,0:07:35.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, naughty dog is going to help you think about this
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.12,0:07:41.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,by constantly bringing it up using flashbacks. as Elie grew up in Jackson.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.25,0:07:43.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I promise you before you know it,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.05,0:07:46.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,you might even be convinced that Joel is in fact a villain.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.74,0:07:52.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,This isn't to say that Joel is unlikable character that you should hate him or wish that he were dead,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.65,0:07:56.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,but rather Joel is the one that damned humanity.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.76,0:08:03.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,If you tell any other story and there's a character which damns humanity for the sake of one single person,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.90,0:08:06.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,we would say he's a bad guy.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.00,0:08:08.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,Or perhaps we wouldn't even say bad guy,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.64,0:08:13.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,we would simply say that he was a confused or perhaps mistaken individual,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.56,0:08:15.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,whose motivations were complex.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.90,0:08:20.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the point is, it's not as simple as hero and villain.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.94,0:08:23.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,There is a lot of gray in between.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.19,0:08:28.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now this intro sequence is just shortly after Joel's arrival, while Ellie is still young.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.83,0:08:34.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's living out of grandmothers suite in the back of the house that is presumably owned by Joel.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.53,0:08:36.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's super cute that she has her own space,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.60,0:08:41.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,but it even now shows and tells a lot about their relationship.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.90,0:08:46.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,Now granted, Joel is a middle aged man that found this little girl,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.62,0:08:49.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,and he took her halfway across the country,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.32,0:08:51.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,rescued her from a bunch of cannibals,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.57,0:08:56.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,and now has her in a town that his brother runs with his wife.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.67,0:09:01.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,it could be presumed that her staying in his house could be considered an appropriate.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.71,0:09:03.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I don't think that's the point here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.78,0:09:08.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,Joel is Ellie's "father figure", and I don't think that's a controversial thing to say.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.58,0:09:15.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,The fact that Ellie wants space, physical space separated from him means a lot.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.75,0:09:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,Regardless, we see Ellie and she's drawing something
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.59,0:09:21.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,that will come back time and time again throughout the rest of the game.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.27,0:09:25.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's actually pretty artsy and gifted, artistically,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.05,0:09:29.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,you'll see this in the note book that you'll be using throughout the course of the main game.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.34,0:09:33.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,She often draws pictures of what she sees or sketches out different things
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.67,0:09:36.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,in order to remind her to return to that area
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.52,0:09:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,or simply to keep a journal of the events and happenings of the main story.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.40,0:09:44.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,She's listening to music when Joel comes in.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.01,0:09:48.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,It's a really cute and awkward moment, but it's pretty damn sweet.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.99,0:09:52.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,It doesn't take a body language expert to see that there's a lot of tension here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.83,0:09:57.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,Jole's unsure of how to stand, where to move, how to talk, how to relate to her,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.15,0:09:59.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,and Ellie picks up on this as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.64,0:10:01.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,The tension is really palpable.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.71,0:10:05.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,They both know what happened in Utah hasn't been resolved,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.94,0:10:08.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,but neither knows how to broach the topic,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.16,0:10:10.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,so they simply delay it and push it off.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.56,0:10:16.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,But the point of this sequence is where Joel to express how much he needs Ellie in his life.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:42.51,0:16:46.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,crouched in prone is something that takes a minute to get used to.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.79,0:17:18.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I will admit I appreciate the effort that they put into this because it's still way better than the alternative,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:18.45,0:17:26.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,which would be to have the standard stereotypical sequence where the protagonist goes and has shown how to use a gun.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.58,0:17:30.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's like issue bottles or some crabs.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:31.35,0:17:36.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,Probably the most egregious example would be the opening of follow three when you're given a BB gun,

Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.12,0:19:10.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,But a key thing to understand here is that the player must give it time and effort to stand on its own and justify itself in the same way that you can't judge a book by its cover or a film by its trailer.

Dialogue: 0,0:36:20.49,0:36:22.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,so perhaps if she inhaled spores,
Dialogue: 0,0:36:22.23,0:36:24.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,that would make her very very sick,

Dialogue: 0,4:50:56.77,4:50:58.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's hard to sympathize with her,

Dialogue: 0,4:51:12.76,4:51:14.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,it wasn't a sequel,

Dialogue: 0,4:51:16.63,4:51:18.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie had grown up and become a different person,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:18.85,4:51:30.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,and she was almost unrecognisable from the character she was in the first game at which is why not a dog keep springing up all these flashbacks to kind of remind you of what else you used to be like.
Dialogue: 0,4:51:31.30,4:51:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,But that isn't enough because you're playing in the current timeline.

Dialogue: 0,4:51:41.08,4:51:43.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,So when we bring up the question,

Dialogue: 0,4:51:47.86,4:51:50.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think for the story they were trying to tell she was well written,
Dialogue: 0,4:51:50.95,4:52:03.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it accomplish the purpose which for naughty dog was to make you sympathize with somebody that killed a character you loved and cared about to make you see the other side of the story.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:03.58,4:52:17.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,to understand all the perspectives and to get that sometimes violence isn't the answer and sometimes terrible things happen and are somewhat justified or that you could even find yourself in the shoes of that character.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:17.56,4:52:22.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,doing that thing if you were put into some sort of like different circumstances,

Dialogue: 0,4:52:23.17,4:52:25.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I think that that's a really interesting.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:26.32,4:52:27.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,Story to tell,
Dialogue: 0,4:52:27.76,4:52:29.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I think that's a fair story to tell,
Dialogue: 0,4:52:29.29,4:52:31.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,and that's when I think of the game.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:31.06,4:52:31.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,That way,
Dialogue: 0,4:52:31.84,4:52:36.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,I find myself much more impressed with it and thinking that it's absolutely a masterpiece.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:37.42,4:52:49.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I think my frustration is that it was a last of us game and that they sacrifice not just Joel but also Ellie at the altar of that story.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:49.09,4:52:58.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,Because I don't think that creating new characters and telling the story from start to finish with new characters would have been as successful.
Dialogue: 0,4:52:58.24,4:53:02.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think part of what makes that story arc of forgiving,

Dialogue: 0,4:53:06.13,4:53:15.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,I think that's part of what of what makes it so impressive is that you are dealing with characters you've known effectively for a decade.

Dialogue: 0,4:53:22.45,4:53:26.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,And I think that that's just what's really frustrating,
Dialogue: 0,4:53:26.47,4:53:33.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,but understandable is that they sacrifice these two characters that you love for the sake of telling this story.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:33.34,4:53:40.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,When they reassured us prior to launch that they were doing what was best for the characters that they weren't going to do them dirty,
Dialogue: 0,4:53:40.84,4:53:44.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,that this was what was best for Joel and Ellie,
Dialogue: 0,4:53:44.08,4:53:48.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they wouldn't be making the game if they didn't feel as though it was the right story to tell.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:49.72,4:53:53.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,So I can understand the frustration on that end.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:53.80,4:53:57.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,A lot of people also are frustrated that the game doesn't seem to have a happy ending.
Dialogue: 0,4:53:57.46,4:54:00.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,That Ellie lost everything that moves on.
Dialogue: 0,4:54:01.24,4:54:03.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,forgets Joel and forgets Dena,
Dialogue: 0,4:54:03.94,4:54:07.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,and leaves everything behind and seemingly has lost.
Dialogue: 0,4:54:07.24,4:54:14.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,Everything hasn't gained anything other than may be coming to grips and peace with what happened with Joel moving on,

Dialogue: 0,4:54:17.14,4:54:21.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,But I actually think that there's remnants of a happy ending here,
Dialogue: 0,4:54:21.13,4:54:23.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's something that's a small detail,
Dialogue: 0,4:54:23.02,4:54:35.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,and it's something I didn't really consider until a good number of people had tweeted it at me and had mentioned it on the discord.
Dialogue: 0,4:54:35.02,4:54:37.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,And it's something that once I started to investigate it,
Dialogue: 0,4:54:37.15,4:54:38.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,I was kind of blown away,
Dialogue: 0,4:54:38.11,4:54:46.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,and I thought that it's actually really interesting theory because you see at the end of the core story of the last of his part to after Eliot Abbey have their fight out.
Dialogue: 0,4:54:47.05,4:54:50.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,Ellie is not wearing any sort of adornment;

Dialogue: 0,4:54:53.26,4:54:58.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,but when you see her back at the farmhouse in the final scene of the game,

Dialogue: 0,4:55:01.75,4:55:05.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why it's interesting that they included it As part of the collector's edition.

Dialogue: 0,4:55:13.54,4:55:16.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,it's just it's a crappy little collector's edition.
Dialogue: 0,4:55:16.99,4:55:17.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,You know,

Dialogue: 0,4:55:21.10,4:55:24.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,But Ellie is wearing that and alleys wearing it,
Dialogue: 0,4:55:24.82,4:55:29.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,even though seemingly she's split up with Dena,
Dialogue: 0,4:55:29.53,4:55:34.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,Andina moved away and has completely cut ties.
Dialogue: 0,4:55:34.48,4:55:39.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,And the theory basically goes that they've returned to the house after a good amount of time.
Dialogue: 0,4:55:39.88,4:55:42.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,At least Ellie has the house is cleared out,
Dialogue: 0,4:55:42.94,4:55:45.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,and they've decided to completely move on from Jackson.

Dialogue: 0,4:55:46.72,4:55:54.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,which is why the house is much more dilapidated and alli has decided to leave all of joles things behind because she needs to move on,
Dialogue: 0,4:55:54.82,4:55:57.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,and she needs to stop bringing this with her.
Dialogue: 0,4:55:57.49,4:56:08.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,And so her wearing of the bracelet isn't just meant to symbolise that she still feels a connection with Dena,

Dialogue: 0,4:56:12.04,4:56:21.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,But that it's actually a direct message that she Indiana are back together and that they've decided to move on together.

Dialogue: 0,4:56:28.84,4:56:33.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,perhaps perhaps not many things in the last of us at the world of the last of us,
Dialogue: 0,4:56:33.97,4:56:35.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,have happy endings.
Dialogue: 0,4:56:35.29,4:56:38.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,but I think the tone of the end of the game is very uplifting.
