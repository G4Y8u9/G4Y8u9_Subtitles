- Ellie: And you need to stop harassing Jesse about my patrols.

- Joel: I'm not trying to--
- Ellie: I was supposed to die in that hospital. My life would've fucking mattered. But you took that from me.
- Joel: If somehow the Lord gave me a second chance at that moment… I would do it all over again.
- Ellie: Yeah… I just… I don't think I can ever forgive you for that. But I would like to try.
- Joel: I'd like that.
- Ellie: Okay. I'll see you around.
- Joel: Yep.
