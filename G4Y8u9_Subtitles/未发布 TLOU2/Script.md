- Joel: Hey.
- Ellie: What're you drinking?
- Joel: Coffee.
- Ellie: Where'd you get that?
- Joel: Uh, those people that came through last week.
- Ellie: Oh.
- Joel: A little embarrassed as to what I had to trade to get it, but… it's not bad.
- Ellie: I had Seth under control.
- Joel: Yeah, I know.
- Ellie: And you need to stop harassing Jesse about my patrols.
- Joel: Okay. Dina. Is she your girlfriend?
- Ellie: No! No. She-- That was just one kiss. It doesn't mean anything. She just… I don't know why she did that.
- Joel: You do like her.
- Ellie: I'm so stupid.
- Joel: Look, I have no idea what that girl's intentions are, but… I do know that she would be lucky to have you.
- Ellie: You're such an asshole!
- Joel: I'm not trying to--
- Ellie: I was supposed to die in that hospital. My life would've fucking mattered. But you took that from me.
- Joel: If somehow the Lord gave me a second chance at that moment… I would do it all over again.
- Ellie: Yeah… I just… I don't think I can ever forgive you for that. But I would like to try.
- Joel: I'd like that.
- Ellie: Okay. I'll see you around.
- Joel: Yep.
