Dialogue: 1,0:00:00.12,0:00:04.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们想没想过火箭入轨精度为什么那么高
Dialogue: 2,0:00:00.12,0:00:04.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Have you ever wondered, how do real-world rocket vehicles get to orbit with such an accuracy,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:04.72,0:00:08.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,能和速度近每秒8公里的空间站交会对接?
Dialogue: 2,0:00:04.72,0:00:08.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they meet and dock with a space station traveling at almost eight kilometers per second?
Dialogue: 1,0:00:08.99,0:00:13.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,长懒不看版答案: 这需要箭载计算机上高深的算法
Dialogue: 2,0:00:08.99,0:00:13.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,The short answer is: through some very ingenious algorithms in their onboard computers.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:13.50,0:00:15.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,细说的话 我叫Przemek
Dialogue: 2,0:00:13.50,0:00:15.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the long answer: my name is Przemek,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:15.32,0:00:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,欢迎观看航天飞机制导算法在坎巴拉太空计划中的实现
Dialogue: 2,0:00:15.32,0:00:18.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is Space Shuttle guidance done in Kerbal Space Program.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:18.87,0:00:22.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,假设我们要给空间站送快递
Dialogue: 2,0:00:18.87,0:00:22.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say we want to deliver some supplies to the International Space Station.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:22.34,0:00:24.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家之前也玩过KSP
Dialogue: 2,0:00:22.34,0:00:24.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, you've flown those missions before in Kerbal Space Program,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:24.81,0:00:28.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,知道如果发射后进入的轨道比较好 交会对接就会很轻松
Dialogue: 2,0:00:24.81,0:00:28.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you know it's not so very hard to rendezvous, once we're in a good orbit.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:28.49,0:00:32.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果你初始轨道和目标轨道有倾角 那就不好办了
Dialogue: 2,0:00:28.49,0:00:32.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if your initial orbit is inclined to your target, things get pretty complicated.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:32.79,0:00:36.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这类发射中最重要、最难的部分就是进入停泊轨道这一步
Dialogue: 2,0:00:32.79,0:00:36.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the most difficult and important part of such launch is the ascent to parking orbit.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:36.89,0:00:40.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我为此专门设计了一套上升段的自动驾驶程序
Dialogue: 2,0:00:36.89,0:00:40.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I have created an ascent autopilot that does exactly that.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:40.37,0:00:41.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,使用kOS编写
Dialogue: 2,0:00:40.37,0:00:41.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was programmed in kOS
Dialogue: 1,0:00:41.84,0:00:44.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,这MOD是坠吼的 不知道的话欢迎去试试
Dialogue: 2,0:00:41.84,0:00:44.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,(one of the best mods out there, so do look it up if you don't know it already)
Dialogue: 1,0:00:44.69,0:00:47.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,它使用航天飞机的算法来进行入轨制导
Dialogue: 2,0:00:44.69,0:00:47.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it uses the Space Shuttle's algorithm for orbital guidance.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:47.79,0:00:50.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,我的代码非常灵活 适用于很多其他火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:00:47.79,0:00:50.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,My implementation is flexible enough that we can run other vehicles too,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:50.76,0:00:54.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这个视频里我将使用 "Real Scale Boosters" MOD里的Atlas V进行演示
Dialogue: 2,0:00:50.76,0:00:54.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,so to demonstrate, I'll use the Atlas V from Real Scale Boosters mod.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:54.54,0:00:58.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,使用我的自动驾驶程序进行这样的发射任务 只需选定目标
Dialogue: 2,0:00:54.54,0:00:58.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, using my autopilot, flying such missions is as easy as select target,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:01.14,0:01:03.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后输入 "run PEGAS"
Dialogue: 2,0:01:01.14,0:01:03.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,and run PEGAS.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:05.49,0:01:09.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,程序一开始会计算发射窗口
Dialogue: 2,0:01:05.49,0:01:09.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the first thing that happens is calculation of the launch window.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:09.19,0:01:10.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上只是一个粗略估计
Dialogue: 2,0:01:09.19,0:01:10.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, it's just a rough estimate,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:10.84,0:01:14.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为即使在现实中也很难精确计算
Dialogue: 2,0:01:10.84,0:01:14.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,because in reality it's very difficult to calculate it precisely,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:14.24,0:01:15.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们只做粗略估计即可
Dialogue: 2,0:01:14.24,0:01:15.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we'll make do with that.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:15.64,0:01:18.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为整个代码不需要发射窗口计算有多精确
Dialogue: 2,0:01:15.64,0:01:18.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,Fortunately the whole system is fairly insensitive to that
Dialogue: 1,0:01:18.49,0:01:21.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,前后差一两分钟问题不大
Dialogue: 2,0:01:18.49,0:01:21.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and being off by a minute or two shouldn't be a big issue.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:21.49,0:01:24.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在开始 火箭的姿态和分级就完全交由PEGAS控制了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:21.49,0:01:24.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,From this point, our vehicle is in complete control of PEGAS
Dialogue: 1,0:01:24.74,0:01:26.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在开始 火箭的姿态和分级就完全交由PEGAS控制了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:24.74,0:01:26.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,which handles staging and attitude.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:27.19,0:01:30.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,倒计时!
Dialogue: 2,0:01:27.19,0:01:30.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have the final countdown,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:31.24,0:01:33.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,RD-180发动机点火!
Dialogue: 2,0:01:31.24,0:01:33.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,there should be the RD-180 ignition,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.79,0:01:36.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,AJ-60固推点火! 起飞!
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.79,0:01:36.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,and now the AJ-60s and liftoff!
Dialogue: 1,0:01:37.92,0:01:40.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,发射分两个阶段
Dialogue: 2,0:01:37.92,0:01:40.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, there are usually two phases of ascent to orbit:
Dialogue: 1,0:01:40.79,0:01:43.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,首先是大气层内的上升段
Dialogue: 2,0:01:40.79,0:01:43.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the first one, we're in now - atmospheric ascent.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:43.99,0:01:48.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,这时候不用多精确 飞得稳你就成功了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:43.99,0:01:48.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the idea here is not so much about precision of what we're doing, as is about safety.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:48.89,0:01:51.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,这时候主要目标是让你的火箭能完整的飞出大气层
Dialogue: 2,0:01:48.89,0:01:51.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,We just want to get outside the atmosphere in one piece
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.79,0:01:54.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,而不是被迎面而来的大风(动压)吹散架了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:51.79,0:01:54.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of breaking up due to high dynamic loads.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.39,0:01:55.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,程序在这里的逻辑就是遵循FAR的教程
Dialogue: 2,0:01:54.39,0:01:55.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the logic we're following
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.79,0:01:59.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,程序在这里的逻辑就是遵循FAR的教程
Dialogue: 2,0:01:55.79,0:01:59.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,is taken pretty much straight from ferram's Realism Overhaul tutorial,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:59.39,0:02:02.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,先转一定的角度 然后姿态上保持零攻角一直飞就好
Dialogue: 2,0:01:59.39,0:02:02.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,so basically pitch over by some known angle
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.14,0:02:05.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,先转一定的角度 然后姿态上保持零攻角一直飞就好
Dialogue: 2,0:02:02.14,0:02:05.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and hold attitude prograde at zero angle of attack.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:05.19,0:02:09.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,等我们飞到大气足够稀薄的地方 动压小了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:05.19,0:02:09.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,And once we've gained enough altitude that air density is no longer an issue,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:09.04,0:02:13.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,就要切换到发射入轨的航天飞机制导算法了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:09.04,0:02:13.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we will switch to orbital ascent using the Space Shuttle algorithm.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.56,0:02:16.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,即PEG 全称"动力显式制导"
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.56,0:02:16.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you ever heard the word PEG or Powered Explicit Guidance,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:16.50,0:02:18.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,即PEG 全称"动力显式制导"
Dialogue: 2,0:02:16.50,0:02:18.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,then this is exactly it, this is one way of referring to it.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:18.94,0:02:22.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外有一点 包括航天飞机在内 绝大多数轨道制导算法
Dialogue: 2,0:02:18.94,0:02:22.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, the thing about most orbital guidance algorithms, Shuttle's included,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:22.34,0:02:25.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,并不考虑大气层的存在
Dialogue: 2,0:02:22.34,0:02:25.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that they do not take atmosphere into account at all.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:25.40,0:02:29.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我给自己留了个台阶 毕竟我真不清楚最先进的算法是啥样的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:25.40,0:02:29.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,Although take that with a grain of salt, as I don't know about the most modern algorithms.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.34,0:02:32.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为空气动力学背后的数学真的非常复杂
Dialogue: 2,0:02:29.34,0:02:32.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because maths behind aerodynamics are very complex
Dialogue: 1,0:02:32.52,0:02:35.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,在当时那个年代 很难在飞行中实时解算出结果
Dialogue: 2,0:02:32.52,0:02:35.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,and back then it couldn't be quickly and reliably solved mid-flight.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:35.83,0:02:39.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以大气层内的阶段 由于主要目标是省油和大致的准确
Dialogue: 2,0:02:35.83,0:02:39.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, because in that phase the only thing that matters is precision and fuel efficiency,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:39.84,0:02:44.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们只要等它飞出大气层 空气动力学效应可以忽略就好
Dialogue: 2,0:02:39.84,0:02:44.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're better off waiting till we're above the air, so we can neglect its effects.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:03.79,0:03:07.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在固推差不多该烧完了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:03.79,0:03:07.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,And right about now the SRBs should be flaming out,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.59,0:03:12.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们等一会再抛固推
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.59,0:03:12.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to jettison them a little later.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:12.19,0:03:15.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,现实中Atlas V也是这样做的 火箭会带着烧完的固推再飞几秒
Dialogue: 2,0:03:12.19,0:03:15.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually what the real Atlas does, it carries them for a few seconds,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:15.59,0:03:19.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为空气可能还没那么稀薄 扔太早不安全
Dialogue: 2,0:03:15.59,0:03:19.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,as it might be unsafe to separate if we're too low and the air is too dense,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.35,0:03:21.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们让火箭再飞一会
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.35,0:03:21.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we carry them for a little bit.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.34,0:03:28.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在自动制导程序激活 接管火箭姿态控制
Dialogue: 2,0:03:23.34,0:03:28.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now the automatic guidance will engage and take control of attitude.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:29.72,0:03:32.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是谁钦点这算法叫"航天飞机制导算法"的?
Dialogue: 2,0:03:29.72,0:03:32.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,But why the Space Shuttle? And why the Shuttle's guidance algorithm?
Dialogue: 1,0:03:32.59,0:03:34.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,它有什么特别的吗?
Dialogue: 2,0:03:32.59,0:03:34.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what's so special about it?
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.04,0:03:37.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,想回答这个问题 我们得先回到六十年代末
Dialogue: 2,0:03:34.04,0:03:37.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, to understand that we need to go back in time to late 1960s
Dialogue: 1,0:03:37.99,0:03:39.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,当时航天飞机还没有出现
Dialogue: 2,0:03:37.99,0:03:39.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the Shuttle doesn't exist yet -
Dialogue: 1,0:03:39.44,0:03:42.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,只停留在图纸与一堆需求提案中
Dialogue: 2,0:03:39.44,0:03:42.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,not beyond drawing boards, proposals and requirements.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:42.39,0:03:46.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,当时有两大特别的需求
Dialogue: 2,0:03:42.39,0:03:46.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,And two of those requirements are of particular interest to us right now.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.04,0:03:49.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,一个是新飞船要能在轨建造并维护空间站
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.04,0:03:49.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first one was the ability of the newly designed vehicle
Dialogue: 1,0:03:49.09,0:03:52.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,一个是新飞船要能在轨建造并维护空间站
Dialogue: 2,0:03:49.09,0:03:52.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,to allow construction and servicing of a low orbit space station,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:52.44,0:03:55.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,也就是后来家喻户晓的国际空间站
Dialogue: 2,0:03:52.44,0:03:55.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,which will be later known as the International Space Station.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:55.79,0:03:59.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一个需求是除了能发射卫星外 还要能把卫星从轨道上带回来
Dialogue: 2,0:03:55.79,0:03:59.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other was the ability to retrieve satellites from orbit and not just deliver them.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:59.58,0:04:01.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,这两点需求有个共同点
Dialogue: 2,0:03:59.58,0:04:01.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both those objectives have one thing in common:
Dialogue: 1,0:04:01.69,0:04:04.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,都需要有能力进行在轨交会
Dialogue: 2,0:04:01.69,0:04:04.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,they share a mission profile of an orbital rendezvous.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:04.48,0:04:06.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然这倒不是什么新的操作
Dialogue: 2,0:04:04.48,0:04:06.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,This isn't to say that rendezvous was something new,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.79,0:04:10.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些东西在之前的双子星座计划就演示过了 阿波罗计划里也玩烂了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.79,0:04:10.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the concept was demonstrated in the Gemini program before and used extensively in Apollo.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:10.99,0:04:14.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是这从来没像这样放进火箭设计的常规需求里
Dialogue: 2,0:04:10.99,0:04:14.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just never before has this kind of mission profile been a routine one.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:14.12,0:04:18.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 航天飞机需要一个全新的制导系统
Dialogue: 2,0:04:14.12,0:04:18.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for this reason, among others, the Shuttle needed an entirely new guidance algorithm.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.49,0:04:20.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是在70年代初
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.49,0:04:20.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,And indeed, in the early 70s,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:20.24,0:04:24.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,德雷伯实验室设计出了"统一动力飞行制导"算法
Dialogue: 2,0:04:20.24,0:04:24.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Unified Powered Flight Guidance was designed by the Draper laboratory.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:24.19,0:04:28.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,"统一"是因为这个系统是为很多飞行模式设计的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.19,0:04:28.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was called "unified" because it was a single program to handle many kinds of flight modes:

Dialogue: 2,0:06:02.68,0:06:08.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,But before we focus on "how" let's answer "what" it really does - the very idea of rocket guidance.

Dialogue: 2,0:06:08.10,0:06:11.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,As a general principle, we want to steer a known vehicle

Dialogue: 1,0:06:14.66,0:06:17.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于发射模式来说 目标就是某条轨道
Dialogue: 2,0:06:14.66,0:06:17.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,which in the ascent mode happens to be some kind of orbit.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:17.88,0:06:21.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在轨道一般是用一组轨道根数来描述的
Dialogue: 2,0:06:17.88,0:06:21.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this orbit is most likely described with a set of orbital elements

Dialogue: 1,0:06:28.07,0:06:29.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这些数值很难处理
Dialogue: 2,0:06:28.07,0:06:29.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's very uncomfortable however -

Dialogue: 2,0:06:32.13,0:06:34.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know it's impossible unless you're currently at periapse.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:34.64,0:06:36.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,改变倾角得在升交点赤经也同理
Dialogue: 2,0:06:34.64,0:06:36.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,Similar thing with inclination and LAN -
Dialogue: 1,0:06:36.60,0:06:40.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,想只改变一个参数而不碰其他值太难了 这对制导算法来说很不友好
Dialogue: 2,0:06:36.60,0:06:40.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's hard to change one without the other, which isn't good for guidance at all.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:40.78,0:06:44.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,而在理想情况下 我们想在某个直观的 比如平面直角坐标系下处理数据

Dialogue: 1,0:06:46.31,0:06:51.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,在直角坐标系里描述当前状态还算简单 但描述目标轨道就不一样了
Dialogue: 2,0:06:46.31,0:06:51.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,In XYZ it's fairly easy to describe our current state, but it's not the same with a target orbit.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:51.67,0:06:54.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟轨道不是一个点 而是一整条椭圆
Dialogue: 2,0:06:51.67,0:06:54.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, orbit is not a single point but a whole ellipse of them,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:54.89,0:06:57.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以用这样的坐标系描述椭圆也不太现实
Dialogue: 2,0:06:54.89,0:06:57.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,so such description is not really possible.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:57.43,0:07:00.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果我们已知XYZ坐标和速度
Dialogue: 2,0:06:57.43,0:07:00.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,However if we were given some XYZ position and velocity,
Dialogue: 1,0:07:00.62,0:07:03.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就很容易判断当前轨道是否达标
Dialogue: 2,0:07:00.62,0:07:03.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,we could easily verify whether it is a good orbit or not -
Dialogue: 1,0:07:03.69,0:07:06.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,只需要一一核对高度 速度 角度之类的就行了
Dialogue: 2,0:07:03.69,0:07:06.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,simply by checking altitude velocity angle and the like.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:06.37,0:07:09.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,其实这样已经足够我们去进行精确制导了
Dialogue: 2,0:07:06.37,0:07:09.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it turns out, this is enough to do very precise guidance.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:09.66,0:07:13.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,剩下就是火箭本身了 你要知道自己该去调整哪些参数
Dialogue: 2,0:07:09.66,0:07:13.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,One remaining thing is the vehicle - after all, we need to know exactly what are we steering.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:13.96,0:07:17.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们可以总结出很多火箭的参数
Dialogue: 2,0:07:13.96,0:07:17.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,In general, there will be plenty of parameters we could write down about it,
Dialogue: 1,0:07:17.86,0:07:21.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对于火箭的运动 只有四个参数是有用的
Dialogue: 2,0:07:17.86,0:07:21.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,but from the point of view of rocket motion, it all boils down to just four:
Dialogue: 1,0:07:21.99,0:07:25.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭干重 剩余燃料重量
Dialogue: 2,0:07:21.99,0:07:25.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,dry mass of the vehicle, mass of the propellant it has in the tanks
Dialogue: 1,0:07:25.38,0:07:29.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及发动机参数 即推力与比冲
Dialogue: 2,0:07:25.38,0:07:29.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,and parameters of its engines: combined thrust and specific impulse.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:29.11,0:07:30.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,简言之就是重量 推力 推力效率(比冲)
Dialogue: 2,0:07:29.11,0:07:30.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, how much does it weigh,

Dialogue: 2,0:07:30.91,0:07:33.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,how hard can it push itself and how efficiently can it do that.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:33.63,0:07:37.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于多级火箭 每一级都会有相应的四组数据
Dialogue: 2,0:07:33.63,0:07:37.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we have a multi-stage vehicle, there will be those four numbers per each stage -
Dialogue: 1,0:07:37.74,0:07:41.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,这会导致很难把它们套进数学公式
Dialogue: 2,0:07:37.74,0:07:41.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,which in turn isn't so very comfortable to plug into any mathematical equation.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:41.20,0:07:45.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是设计制导系统的大佬们又发明了推力积分
Dialogue: 2,0:07:41.20,0:07:45.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the clever guys from guidance came up with something called thrust integrals.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:45.88,0:07:49.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,就不在这细讲了 怕大家睡着
Dialogue: 2,0:07:45.88,0:07:49.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will not give a detailed explanation of them here, as this would be unnecessarily boring,

Dialogue: 2,0:07:49.48,0:07:51.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,just outline the greatest advantage they give us.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:51.73,0:07:56.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,推力积分让我们能够合并火箭的各级参数
Dialogue: 2,0:07:51.73,0:07:56.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,The thrust integrals allow us to coalesce the vehicle description into one set of numbers,
Dialogue: 1,0:07:56.56,0:07:58.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用去管火箭的分级数量
Dialogue: 2,0:07:56.56,0:07:58.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,irregardless of the number of stages.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:58.42,0:08:01.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 多亏了推力积分 让算法也能对多级火箭进行制导了
Dialogue: 2,0:07:58.42,0:08:01.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, thanks to that, the capability to guide multistage vehicles

Dialogue: 2,0:08:01.94,0:08:04.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,is kind of built into the algorithm itself.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:04.38,0:08:06.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然航天飞机其实并没有占到多少便宜
Dialogue: 2,0:08:04.38,0:08:06.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,Even though the Shuttle did not really make full use of that,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:06.59,0:08:09.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为航天飞机主要部分仍是单级的
Dialogue: 2,0:08:06.59,0:08:09.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the major part it was a single stage vehicle,
Dialogue: 1,0:08:09.10,0:08:12.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,它的OMS发动机只是用来圆轨
Dialogue: 2,0:08:09.10,0:08:12.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,the OMS thrusters were used only to circularize.

Dialogue: 2,0:08:25.75,0:08:30.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we have a way of figuring out whether our destination - if we had one - is a good one.
Dialogue: 1,0:08:30.58,0:08:34.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们基本上不知道我们要去哪里这件事听起来好像怪怪的
Dialogue: 2,0:08:30.58,0:08:34.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,The fact that we essentially don't know where we're going might seem like a bit of a problem,

Dialogue: 2,0:09:23.73,0:09:26.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is obviously wrong, so our result will be wrong
Dialogue: 1,0:09:26.53,0:09:30.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为现实中地球是圆的 重力方向也会变
Dialogue: 2,0:09:26.53,0:09:30.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,because in reality, the spherical Earth's gravity will pull us down differently.
Dialogue: 1,0:09:30.28,0:09:34.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以设计UPFG的人想到一个绝妙的办法来修正
Dialogue: 2,0:09:30.28,0:09:34.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the guys who designed UPFG came up with a neat way to correct that.
Dialogue: 1,0:09:34.10,0:09:39.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们设计一个函数来预测火箭未来只受重力作用下的状态
Dialogue: 2,0:09:34.10,0:09:39.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,They designed a function to predict the future state of a vehicle in free motion under just gravity,

Dialogue: 1,0:09:41.64,0:09:44.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后想办法把推力带进去
Dialogue: 2,0:09:41.64,0:09:44.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then figured out a way to incorporate thrust into it.
Dialogue: 1,0:09:44.38,0:09:47.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样就有了一个精度尚可的未来状态推断
Dialogue: 2,0:09:44.38,0:09:47.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,This way, they ended up with a decent future state predictor,
Dialogue: 1,0:09:47.63,0:09:52.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,利用这两个工具 我们可以先用线性正切制导律粗略计算
Dialogue: 2,0:09:47.63,0:09:52.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,using which we can: first calculate a rough guidance using Linear Tangent,
Dialogue: 1,0:09:52.04,0:09:56.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后使用圆锥曲线状态外推计算考虑重力矢量的实际情况
Dialogue: 2,0:09:52.04,0:09:56.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,then use Conic State Extrapolation to find out what the gravity vector really would be like,

Dialogue: 2,0:09:57.96,0:10:02.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plug it back into the LTG, gradually increasing the accuracy of its results.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:02.15,0:10:07.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,而实际上 最开始的误差可能不只是对重力处理上的误差
Dialogue: 2,0:10:02.15,0:10:07.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in fact, the initial inaccuracy might not be only due to bad gravity handling.

Dialogue: 2,0:10:07.01,0:10:10.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,We simply might have guessed our target wrong - would be good to correct for that too.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:10.89,0:10:15.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以UPFG并不是慢慢调整我们初始的预测值
Dialogue: 2,0:10:10.89,0:10:15.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the way UPFG approaches that is not by slowly correcting our initial guess.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:15.13,0:10:19.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是直接拿最接近解算出的结果作为新的目标
Dialogue: 2,0:10:15.13,0:10:19.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead it finds an entirely new target position, that is nearest to the predicted one,

Dialogue: 2,0:10:19.99,0:10:22.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and discards our guess at all in the process.

Dialogue: 2,0:10:35.42,0:10:38.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we verify our guess in the target by picking a new one.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:38.26,0:10:41.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,不准就拿新的预测值重新跑一遍算法
Dialogue: 2,0:10:38.26,0:10:41.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we run the algorithm again with that new value.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:41.00,0:10:46.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,重复几次 误差就会越来越小
Dialogue: 2,0:10:41.00,0:10:46.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we repeat this process several times, the error will get smaller and smaller as we go,
Dialogue: 1,0:10:46.03,0:10:48.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,小到最终无限接近真实结果
Dialogue: 2,0:10:46.03,0:10:48.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,and at some point it will become so little,
Dialogue: 1,0:10:48.05,0:10:52.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,这时就可以说解算完成了 误差已经解决掉啦
Dialogue: 2,0:10:48.05,0:10:52.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we might safely say that a true solution has been found - one that has no errors anymore.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:52.31,0:10:55.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,此时称为"算法收敛"
Dialogue: 2,0:10:52.31,0:10:55.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when that happens, we say that the algorithm has converged.
Dialogue: 1,0:10:55.38,0:10:57.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,由此就可以遵循制导系统运行了
Dialogue: 2,0:10:55.38,0:10:57.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,From then on we can follow its guidance.

Dialogue: 2,0:11:04.13,0:11:06.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, I didn't go into much detail
