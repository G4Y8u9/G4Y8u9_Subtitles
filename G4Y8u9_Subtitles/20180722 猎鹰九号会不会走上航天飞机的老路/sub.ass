Dialogue: 2,0:23:30.70,0:23:32.84,英,,0,0,0,,So some final thoughts on all this.
Dialogue: 1,0:23:33.08,0:23:37.69,中,,0,0,0,,首先 为什么我觉得猎鹰九号可以实现低价可复用
Dialogue: 2,0:23:33.08,0:23:37.69,英,,0,0,0,,First off, the reason why I think the Falcon 9 will actually achieve reusability,
Dialogue: 1,0:23:37.69,0:23:39.24,中,,0,0,0,,而航天飞机做不到
Dialogue: 2,0:23:37.69,0:23:39.24,英,,0,0,0,,when the Space Shuttle couldn't
Dialogue: 1,0:23:39.37,0:23:42.68,中,,0,0,0,,主要原因是SpaceX的工程理念
Dialogue: 2,0:23:39.37,0:23:42.68,英,,0,0,0,,is mostly due to the engineering philosophy of SpaceX.
Dialogue: 1,0:23:42.68,0:23:45.03,中,,0,0,0,,SpaceX的火箭不断修改进化的
Dialogue: 2,0:23:42.68,0:23:45.03,英,,0,0,0,,They are constantly tweaking their rocket
Dialogue: 1,0:23:45.03,0:23:49.53,中,,0,0,0,,用SpaceX生产部副总Andy Lambert的话说
Dialogue: 2,0:23:45.03,0:23:49.53,英,,0,0,0,,to the point where according to SpaceX's VP of production, Andy Lambert.
Dialogue: 1,0:23:49.53,0:23:53.39,中,,0,0,0,,"SpaceX从未制造 '两个完全相同的火箭'
Dialogue: 2,0:23:49.53,0:23:53.39,英,,0,0,0,,SpaceX has never built any two vehicles identically,
Dialogue: 1,0:23:53.48,0:23:56.19,中,,0,0,0,,这就是SpaceX的创新步伐"
Dialogue: 2,0:23:53.48,0:23:56.19,英,,0,0,0,,such is the pace of innovation at SpaceX."
Dialogue: 1,0:23:56.19,0:23:58.95,中,,0,0,0,,而航天飞机完全不是这样
Dialogue: 2,0:23:56.19,0:23:58.95,英,,0,0,0,,Now this is quite different from the Space Shuttle,
Dialogue: 1,0:23:58.95,0:24:01.72,中,,0,0,0,,总共只有五艘用于飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:23:58.95,0:24:01.72,英,,0,0,0,,that had only only five operational vehicles,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:01.72,0:24:05.13,中,,0,0,0,,30年间的更新也非常少
Dialogue: 2,0:24:01.72,0:24:05.13,英,,0,0,0,,that changed very little in their 30 years of operation.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:05.31,0:24:10.36,中,,0,0,0,,事实上 航天飞机的第一阶段只有哥伦比亚号的四次飞行
Dialogue: 2,0:24:05.31,0:24:10.36,英,,0,0,0,,As a matter of fact, phase one of the Space Shuttle was only the first four flights of Columbia.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:10.63,0:24:13.27,中,,0,0,0,,在这之后的改进就微乎其微了
Dialogue: 2,0:24:10.63,0:24:13.27,英,,0,0,0,,After that, further development would be minimal.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:13.27,0:24:15.81,中,,0,0,0,,而猎鹰九号 如果某项设计没达到预期
Dialogue: 2,0:24:13.27,0:24:15.81,英,,0,0,0,,But with the Falcon 9, if an idea doesn't work out,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:15.81,0:24:19.90,中,,0,0,0,,SpaceX完全可以在下一枚火箭制造的时候就做出修改
Dialogue: 2,0:24:15.81,0:24:19.90,英,,0,0,0,,they can literally make that change on one of the next manufactured boosters.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:20.00,0:24:22.90,中,,0,0,0,,如果改动较大 就放在下一构型中实现
Dialogue: 2,0:24:20.00,0:24:22.90,英,,0,0,0,,And if it's a really big change they'll do that on the next Block iteration.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:22.90,0:24:25.75,中,,0,0,0,,真要说的话 航天飞机也不是完全没有修改
Dialogue: 2,0:24:22.90,0:24:25.75,英,,0,0,0,,The Space Shuttle's design didn't exactly freeze,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:25.75,0:24:29.46,中,,0,0,0,,但其三十多年的服役周期里做出的修改
Dialogue: 2,0:24:25.75,0:24:29.46,英,,0,0,0,,but it certainly didn't evolve nearly as much in 30 years,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:29.59,0:24:32.13,中,,0,0,0,,实在是比猎鹰九号这8年来少太多了
Dialogue: 2,0:24:29.59,0:24:32.13,英,,0,0,0,,as the Falcon 9 has in eight years.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:32.13,0:24:34.87,中,,0,0,0,,可能有人认为SpaceX这8年步子迈得太大
Dialogue: 2,0:24:32.13,0:24:34.87,英,,0,0,0,,Some might consider this much change reckless,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:35.04,0:24:39.32,中,,0,0,0,,但考虑到其最终目的 是真正可复用的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:24:35.04,0:24:39.32,英,,0,0,0,,but considering the end goal is to actually have a reusable vehicle,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:39.59,0:24:42.29,中,,0,0,0,,我还是更喜欢这样激进的策略
Dialogue: 2,0:24:39.59,0:24:42.29,英,,0,0,0,,I'm really glad they're pushing this aggressively.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:42.61,0:24:44.74,中,,0,0,0,,毕竟一辈子有几个三十年?
Dialogue: 2,0:24:42.61,0:24:44.74,英,,0,0,0,,I just can't wait another 30 years.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:44.74,0:24:49.43,中,,0,0,0,,最后可能还有人认为 SpaceX永远没法把复用成本降到能回本的程度
Dialogue: 2,0:24:44.74,0:24:49.43,英,,0,0,0,,And lastly to those that think SpaceX won't be able to make it worth the cost of reflying,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:49.51,0:24:52.23,中,,0,0,0,,或者质疑这样做到底有什么意义之类
Dialogue: 2,0:24:49.51,0:24:52.23,英,,0,0,0,,or who question whether or not it'll be worth it for them,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:52.46,0:24:55.18,中,,0,0,0,,但幸运的是 这没关系呀!
Dialogue: 2,0:24:52.46,0:24:55.18,英,,0,0,0,,luckily for us, it really doesn't matter.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:55.18,0:24:57.03,中,,0,0,0,,SpaceX是个私企
Dialogue: 2,0:24:55.18,0:24:57.03,英,,0,0,0,,SpaceX is a private company,
Dialogue: 1,0:24:57.09,0:24:59.73,中,,0,0,0,,影响他们抉择的主要因素 只有钱
Dialogue: 2,0:24:57.09,0:24:59.73,英,,0,0,0,,They will only do what makes the most financial sense.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:59.88,0:25:02.67,中,,0,0,0,,也许几年后他们会发现复用火箭回不了本
Dialogue: 2,0:24:59.88,0:25:02.67,英,,0,0,0,,So if after a few years they look back and realize,
Dialogue: 1,0:25:02.78,0:25:06.87,中,,0,0,0,,造新火箭还是比复用火箭省钱省事
Dialogue: 2,0:25:02.78,0:25:06.87,英,,0,0,0,,it's more expensive to try to refly these things than it is to make a new one.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:07.01,0:25:11.01,中,,0,0,0,,那为了赚钱大不了就不干了呗
Dialogue: 2,0:25:07.01,0:25:11.01,英,,0,0,0,,I'm sure they'll stop doing so because they don't wanna lose money.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:11.01,0:25:13.72,中,,0,0,0,,他们没有任何义务去强行让自己的火箭可复用
Dialogue: 2,0:25:11.01,0:25:13.72,英,,0,0,0,,They don't owe it to anyone to reuse their rockets.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:13.91,0:25:18.98,中,,0,0,0,,他们只是认为复用有搞头 觉得能省钱 能让利益最大化
Dialogue: 2,0:25:13.91,0:25:18.98,英,,0,0,0,,It's only in their best interest to figure out how to do so so they can maximize profits.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:18.98,0:25:20.75,中,,0,0,0,,这和航天飞机当年的处境完全不同
Dialogue: 2,0:25:18.98,0:25:20.75,英,,0,0,0,,And that's just different than the Space Shuttle,
Dialogue: 1,0:25:20.75,0:25:25.59,中,,0,0,0,,后者承载着整个国家对可复用性的希望
Dialogue: 2,0:25:20.75,0:25:25.59,英,,0,0,0,,which had the weight of the entire nation's expectations to be reusable.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:25.91,0:25:29.21,中,,0,0,0,,不管整套系统能不能达到预期效果
Dialogue: 2,0:25:25.91,0:25:29.21,英,,0,0,0,,Whether or not the system put in place actually made sense,
Dialogue: 1,0:25:29.64,0:25:30.74,中,,0,0,0,,咬着牙也得让它飞
Dialogue: 2,0:25:29.64,0:25:30.74,英,,0,0,0,,it was too late.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:30.74,0:25:33.72,中,,0,0,0,,怕国会老爷犯嘀咕 所以航天飞机也不敢做大的修改
Dialogue: 2,0:25:30.74,0:25:33.72,英,,0,0,0,,There was no room for major changes per say,
Dialogue: 1,0:25:33.72,0:25:36.12,中,,0,0,0,,怕国会老爷犯嘀咕 所以航天飞机也不敢做大的修改
Dialogue: 2,0:25:33.72,0:25:36.12,英,,0,0,0,,since Congress would probably frown upon.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:36.36,0:25:39.72,中,,0,0,0,,"我觉得这样改不行 咱还是别搞航天飞机了"
Dialogue: 2,0:25:36.36,0:25:39.72,英,,0,0,0,,"Well this didn't work out, let's scrap the entire idea."
Dialogue: 1,0:25:39.83,0:25:44.20,中,,0,0,0,,所以我个人觉得 今天这样一个创新的时代 材料学有了进步
Dialogue: 2,0:25:39.83,0:25:44.20,英,,0,0,0,,So personally I think with this new age of innovation and materials,
Dialogue: 1,0:25:44.35,0:25:46.92,中,,0,0,0,,软硬件也都在飞速发展
Dialogue: 2,0:25:44.35,0:25:46.92,英,,0,0,0,,rapid evolution of hardware and software,
Dialogue: 1,0:25:47.04,0:25:51.44,中,,0,0,0,,决策者只要坚持尝试 总能找到解决办法
Dialogue: 2,0:25:47.04,0:25:51.44,英,,0,0,0,,and leadership that simply requires they keep trying until they figure it out.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:51.44,0:25:56.97,中,,0,0,0,,我觉得我们已经有一只脚踏入可回收火箭 火箭航空化的大门了
Dialogue: 2,0:25:51.44,0:25:56.97,英,,0,0,0,,I think we're finally entering a new era of reusable and airliner like rockets.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:57.43,0:25:58.16,中,,0,0,0,,希望如此吧!
Dialogue: 2,0:25:57.43,0:25:58.16,英,,0,0,0,,Hopefully!
Dialogue: 1,0:26:00.80,0:26:02.59,中,,0,0,0,,所以大家怎么看?
