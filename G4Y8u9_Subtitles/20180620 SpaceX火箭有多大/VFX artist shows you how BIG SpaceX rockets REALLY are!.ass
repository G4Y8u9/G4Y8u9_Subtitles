Dialogue: 1,0:00:08.33,0:00:10.72,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为我们看到的电视上的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:00:08.33,0:00:10.72,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and that's because any time we're showing these rockets
Dialogue: 1,0:00:10.72,0:00:13.15,1080CN,,0,0,0,,要么单独一根摆在那
Dialogue: 2,0:00:10.72,0:00:13.15,1080EN,,0,0,0,,they're always just kind of like by themselves

Dialogue: 1,0:00:21.80,0:00:25.67,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当前太空叉的猎鹰九号火箭高度是230英尺（70米）
Dialogue: 2,0:00:21.80,0:00:25.67,1080EN,,0,0,0,,For instance the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is 230 feet tall
Dialogue: 1,0:00:26.51,0:00:27.88,1080CN,,0,0,0,,但这到底是多高？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:26.51,0:00:27.88,1080EN,,0,0,0,,but what does that mean?
Dialogue: 1,0:00:27.96,0:00:31.18,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以今天让你康康平常见不到的画面
Dialogue: 2,0:00:27.96,0:00:31.18,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So today I'm going to show you what you'll never get to see in real life

Dialogue: 2,0:00:35.70,0:00:41.80,1080EN,,0,0,0,,a better appreciation of the scale of these giant bottles that fly into space
Dialogue: 1,0:00:43.34,0:00:46.89,1080CN,,0,0,0,,首先我们康康猎鹰九号的着陆腿有多大
Dialogue: 2,0:00:43.34,0:00:46.89,1080EN,,0,0,0,,To begin, let's take a look at the Falcon 9 landing legs here
Dialogue: 1,0:00:47.07,0:00:49.70,1080CN,,0,0,0,,在图片或者视频里你们可能以为也就这么大吧
Dialogue: 2,0:00:47.07,0:00:49.70,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And in pictures and videos they seem kind of dinky like
Dialogue: 1,0:00:49.70,0:00:51.44,1080CN,,0,0,0,,在图片或者视频里你们可能以为也就这么大吧
Dialogue: 2,0:00:49.70,0:00:51.44,1080EN,,0,0,0,,maybe they're about this big or so
Dialogue: 1,0:00:51.61,0:00:54.68,1080CN,,0,0,0,,实际上它有29英尺（8.8米）长
Dialogue: 2,0:00:51.61,0:00:54.68,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Whereas in reality there are 29 feet in length
Dialogue: 1,0:00:54.80,0:00:57.47,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当从墙（箭体）上展开时
Dialogue: 2,0:00:54.80,0:00:57.47,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and when unfolded from the wall
Dialogue: 1,0:00:57.47,0:01:04.19,1080CN,,0,0,0,,它能伸出24英尺（7.3米）远，作为对比，我们这房顶只有17英尺（5.2米）高
Dialogue: 2,0:00:57.47,0:01:04.19,1080EN,,0,0,0,,they will reach out 24 feet and to put that into perspective our ceiling is only 17 feet tall
Dialogue: 1,0:01:04.35,0:01:07.44,1080CN,,0,0,0,,我们工作室都放不下一整条着陆腿
Dialogue: 2,0:01:04.35,0:01:07.44,1080EN,,0,0,0,,These legs literally do not fit in our studio
Dialogue: 1,0:01:07.44,0:01:09.98,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这是否给你一点大小的概念呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:01:07.44,0:01:09.98,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And this begins to give you a sense of scale
Dialogue: 1,0:01:10.06,0:01:13.49,1080CN,,0,0,0,,就像我刚说的，猎鹰九号高230英尺（70米）
Dialogue: 2,0:01:10.06,0:01:13.49,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So like I said the Falcon 9 rocket is 230 feet tall meaning that
Dialogue: 1,0:01:13.49,0:01:15.92,1080CN,,0,0,0,,大概是21层楼
Dialogue: 2,0:01:13.49,0:01:15.92,1080EN,,0,0,0,,it's about the height of a 21 storey building
Dialogue: 1,0:01:16.00,0:01:19.15,1080CN,,0,0,0,,但我所在的楼只有七层
Dialogue: 2,0:01:16.00,0:01:19.15,1080EN,,0,0,0,,But the roof that I'm standing on right now is only seven stories tall
Dialogue: 1,0:01:19.44,0:01:23.80,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以我现在高度应该在火箭三分之一处，然后你就仰望吧
Dialogue: 2,0:01:19.44,0:01:23.80,1080EN,,0,0,0,,that puts me about a third of the way up the rocket, and it just keeps going up
Dialogue: 1,0:01:24.41,0:01:27.13,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这还不是太空叉最大的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:01:24.41,0:01:27.13,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And this isn't even the biggest rocket that SpaceX makes
Dialogue: 1,0:01:27.13,0:01:29.66,1080CN,,0,0,0,,他们还有个推力更大的重型猎鹰
Dialogue: 2,0:01:27.13,0:01:29.66,1080EN,,0,0,0,,They have a more powerful one called the Falcon Heavy
Dialogue: 1,0:01:29.85,0:01:35.24,1080CN,,0,0,0,,相当于三个猎鹰九号摆在一起，虽然高度一样，但推力大多了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:29.85,0:01:35.24,1080EN,,0,0,0,,which is basically just three Falcon 9s put together so it's the same height but way more powerful
Dialogue: 1,0:01:35.29,0:01:39.05,1080CN,,0,0,0,,目前重型猎鹰只发射过一次，就是那辆著名的特斯拉
Dialogue: 2,0:01:35.29,0:01:39.05,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So far they've only had a single test flight, famously putting a Tesla Roadster
Dialogue: 1,0:01:39.05,0:01:42.70,1080CN,,0,0,0,,轨道最远到小行星带，绕着太阳还能转几十亿年吧
Dialogue: 2,0:01:39.05,0:01:42.70,1080EN,,0,0,0,,out into the asteroid belt, hood over the Sun for the next billion or so years
Dialogue: 1,0:01:42.70,0:01:45.93,1080CN,,0,0,0,,而因为猎鹰九号太高了，所以乍一看特别苗条
Dialogue: 2,0:01:42.70,0:01:45.93,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And because these rockets are so tall, they appear to be kind of thin
Dialogue: 1,0:01:45.93,0:01:49.53,1080CN,,0,0,0,,但你离近了看，你会发现真不是这样
Dialogue: 2,0:01:45.93,0:01:49.53,1080EN,,0,0,0,,But as usual, when you start getting closer to them, their size becomes apparent
Dialogue: 1,0:01:49.53,0:01:51.28,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为猎鹰九号直径12英尺（3.66米）
Dialogue: 2,0:01:49.53,0:01:51.28,1080EN,,0,0,0,,because they are 12 feet in diameter
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.28,0:01:56.20,1080CN,,0,0,0,,里面能竖着站下两个我
Dialogue: 2,0:01:51.28,0:01:56.20,1080EN,,0,0,0,,I could literally stand on top of myself and still fit on the inside of one of these rockets
Dialogue: 1,0:01:56.38,0:02:00.24,1080CN,,0,0,0,,同时，太空叉还在造更大的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:01:56.38,0:02:00.24,1080EN,,0,0,0,,But here's the thing SpaceX is developing a much much larger rocket
Dialogue: 1,0:02:00.24,0:02:02.75,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为他们带更多货物去更遥远的太空，比如殖民火星
Dialogue: 2,0:02:00.24,0:02:02.75,1080EN,,0,0,0,,because they need something that can go really far into space
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.75,0:02:07.70,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为他们带更多货物去更遥远的太空，比如殖民火星
Dialogue: 2,0:02:02.75,0:02:07.70,1080EN,,0,0,0,,but also carry a lot of weight while they're doing it, like to Mars, like a colony to Mars
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.59,0:02:13.29,1080CN,,0,0,0,,那个更大的火箭就是BFR——“大”“猎鹰”“火箭”
Dialogue: 2,0:02:08.59,0:02:13.29,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So that's what they're making next, the BFR, which stands for Big Falcon Rocket
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.55,0:02:15.13,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为它真的很大
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.55,0:02:15.13,1080EN,,0,0,0,,because it's really Falcon (Fxxking) big
Dialogue: 1,0:02:15.26,0:02:21.24,1080CN,,0,0,0,,BFR高348英尺（106米），比自由女神像还要高
Dialogue: 2,0:02:15.26,0:02:21.24,1080EN,,0,0,0,,At 348 feet tall, the BFR is taller than the Statue of Liberty
Dialogue: 1,0:02:21.24,0:02:25.16,1080CN,,0,0,0,,就算自由女神上面再横着放一个重型猎鹰
Dialogue: 2,0:02:21.24,0:02:25.16,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Even if you were to lay the Falcon Heavy sideways on top of the Statue
Dialogue: 1,0:02:25.16,0:02:28.25,1080CN,,0,0,0,,也没有BFR高
Dialogue: 2,0:02:25.16,0:02:28.25,1080EN,,0,0,0,,it still wouldn't be as tall as the BFR
Dialogue: 1,0:02:28.46,0:02:35.53,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这火箭真的老大了，直径30英尺（9.14米），比伦敦的巴士还要长
Dialogue: 2,0:02:28.46,0:02:35.53,1080EN,,0,0,0,,This rocket is truly massive, with the 30-foot-diameter, it's as wide as a London bus is long
Dialogue: 1,0:02:35.61,0:02:40.27,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你光看上面级的燃料罐你就知道了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:35.61,0:02:40.27,1080EN,,0,0,0,,I mean just look at the fuel tank that's gonna sit in the upper spaceship part of the rocket
Dialogue: 1,0:02:40.27,0:02:44.33,1080CN,,0,0,0,,在2018年中，这火箭应该还不存在，除了马一龙的PPT里
Dialogue: 2,0:02:40.27,0:02:44.33,1080EN,,0,0,0,,As of mid 2018 this rocket doesn't technically exist yet except for the drawing board
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.33,0:02:45.76,1080CN,,0,0,0,,或者像本视频这样的CG里
Dialogue: 2,0:02:44.33,0:02:45.76,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and in CG renderings like this
Dialogue: 1,0:02:45.92,0:02:47.69,1080CN,,0,0,0,,但它真长这样，真的这么大
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.92,0:02:47.69,1080EN,,0,0,0,,But this is it, this is what its gonna look like
Dialogue: 1,0:02:47.69,0:02:52.64,1080CN,,0,0,0,,乐观估计这火箭三年内就能上天，保守估计六年内吧
Dialogue: 2,0:02:47.69,0:02:52.64,1080EN,,0,0,0,,In fact I believe they want to get this up and flying within three years, maybe six years definitely
Dialogue: 1,0:02:52.64,0:02:56.35,1080CN,,0,0,0,,随着火箭越来越大，将来我们可能还会看见更大的火箭
Dialogue: 2,0:02:52.64,0:02:56.35,1080EN,,0,0,0,,And as big as these rockets are, we may someday see rockets that are even larger
Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.35,0:03:00.96,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你看，BFR都没有送人类去月球的土星五号大
Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.35,0:03:00.96,1080EN,,0,0,0,,I mean the BFR is still not as large as the Saturn 5 rocket which took us to the moon
Dialogue: 1,0:03:01.10,0:03:02.78,1080CN,,0,0,0,,而土星五号是50年前的玩意了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:01.10,0:03:02.78,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and we built that 50 years ago
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.83,0:03:08.76,1080CN,,0,0,0,,最后我还想感叹一下，这么大的东西竟然还能跑的比谁都快
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.83,0:03:08.76,1080EN,,0,0,0,,In the end I just find it crazy that these structures are some of the fastest vehicles humanity has ever made
Dialogue: 1,0:03:08.81,0:03:11.42,1080CN,,0,0,0,,要知道，去太空不止是要往上飞
Dialogue: 2,0:03:08.81,0:03:11.42,1080EN,,0,0,0,,because going into space is not just simply a matter of going up
Dialogue: 1,0:03:11.68,0:03:16.92,1080CN,,0,0,0,,而是要先往上飞，然后横着飞，速度快到沿着地球的弧线往下掉才行
Dialogue: 2,0:03:11.68,0:03:16.92,1080EN,,0,0,0,,it's a matter of going up and then sideways so fast that you just continue to fall around the earth
Dialogue: 1,0:03:17.05,0:03:22.81,1080CN,,0,0,0,,而这个速度是17000mph（27359km/h），相当于海平面的22马赫
Dialogue: 2,0:03:17.05,0:03:22.81,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and those speeds are 17,000 miles an hour, at sea level that is Mach 22

Dialogue: 1,0:03:37.26,0:03:40.20,1080CN,,0,0,0,,分享的时候你可以先问问他们心中火箭有多大
Dialogue: 2,0:03:37.26,0:03:40.20,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and asking them first how big that they think rockets are
Dialogue: 1,0:03:40.20,0:03:42.75,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为我猜他们很有可能低估了火箭的大小
Dialogue: 2,0:03:40.20,0:03:42.75,1080EN,,0,0,0,,because I'm willing to bet they're gonna underestimate it
