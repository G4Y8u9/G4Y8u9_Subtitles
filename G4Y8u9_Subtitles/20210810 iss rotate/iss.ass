Dialogue: 1,0:00:04.27,0:00:05.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家好 这里是Scott Manley
Dialogue: 2,0:00:04.27,0:00:05.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hello it's Scott Manley here.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:05.86,0:00:11.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,几天前 毛子的科学号实验舱把整个国际空间站带跑偏了
Dialogue: 2,0:00:05.86,0:00:11.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,A few days ago, the new science module Nauka took the International Space Station for a spin,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:11.75,0:00:15.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家都想知道跑偏到什么程度
Dialogue: 2,0:00:11.75,0:00:15.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and many of you wanted to know just how much of a spin was involved.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:15.49,0:00:22.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,官方说是45度 但我们后来拿到了遥测数据
Dialogue: 2,0:00:15.49,0:00:22.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,The official term had been 45 degrees, but we actually had some telemetry from the station.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:22.24,0:00:26.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以很多人都出来做了各种动画
Dialogue: 2,0:00:22.24,0:00:26.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ... many of you went and set out to try to render this,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:26.20,0:00:30.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,而有意思的事情是 大家都存在一些有趣的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:00:26.20,0:00:30.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the funny thing is, everybody ran into some interesting problems.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:31.00,0:00:38.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个图标来自Liam Kennedy 记录了ISS在当时的滚转 俯仰和偏航角
Dialogue: 2,0:00:31.00,0:00:38.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a nice graph by Liam Kennedy, which basically takes the roll pitch and yaw of the ISS,
Dialogue: 1,0:00:38.26,0:00:43.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,抓取自ISS的实时遥测数据 并绘制出来
Dialogue: 2,0:00:38.26,0:00:43.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,which were taken from this ISS live page and graphs them all out.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:43.87,0:00:49.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人拿到这张图就想做一个动画出来
Dialogue: 2,0:00:43.87,0:00:49.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,And many people decided to take this graph and turn it into actual animation.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:50.08,0:00:55.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是在NASASpaceFlight论坛上两个人发布的动画
Dialogue: 2,0:00:50.08,0:00:55.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is one by erma gerd or Max Steroton on NASA Space Flight that was ...
Dialogue: 1,0:00:55.65,0:00:57.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也太夸张了
Dialogue: 2,0:00:55.65,0:00:57.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,marvelous to see this.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:57.38,0:01:00.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这并不是真实情况
Dialogue: 2,0:00:57.38,0:01:00.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,But ... this is not actually what happened.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:00.12,0:01:06.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然动画时间加速了 但国际空间站做的各种机动还是太鬼畜了
Dialogue: 2,0:01:00.12,0:01:06.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,It certainly does look like the space station's doing something wild, obviously it's accelerated in time.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:06.42,0:01:11.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上动画里很多时刻并没有反映出真实情况
Dialogue: 2,0:01:06.42,0:01:11.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it has many movements that aren't actually consistent with the real thing,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:11.80,0:01:17.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,想了解原因 首先我要让大家知道我自己的想法
Dialogue: 2,0:01:11.80,0:01:17.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,and to understand why, first of all, I want to show you my version of what I think happened.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:17.40,0:01:22.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,如视频所示 这是我第一次在Blender里做3D 从NASA官网上下了个模型放进去
Dialogue: 2,0:01:17.40,0:01:22.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, this is my first attempt to do anything in blender, I just grabbed the model from the NASA site.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:22.53,0:01:28.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,我把星辰号服务舱放在了下面以表示科学号实验舱的位置
Dialogue: 2,0:01:22.53,0:01:28.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,I took, uh, Zvezda and put it on underneath to show where Nauka would be.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:28.45,0:01:31.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,上面没加进步号飞船和龙飞船
Dialogue: 2,0:01:28.45,0:01:31.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,I haven't added in any Progress or Soyuz or Dragon.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:31.86,0:01:34.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过大家知道空间站大体外形就好
Dialogue: 2,0:01:31.86,0:01:34.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you get the idea of the shape of the station, now.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:34.96,0:01:37.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,目前它是在向右运动
Dialogue: 2,0:01:34.96,0:01:37.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is traveling towards the right here,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:37.53,0:01:41.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种情况并不常见 因为毛子舱段竟然在前
Dialogue: 2,0:01:37.53,0:01:41.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is unusual in this orientation, because the Russian section is going first.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:41.94,0:01:45.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,通常情况下是国际舱段在前
Dialogue: 2,0:01:41.94,0:01:45.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,Normally, the international sanction goes first.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:45.86,0:01:53.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味着事件发生之前 国际空间站的姿态相当于是转了180度倒车前进的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:45.86,0:01:53.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that means that in its orientation, before the event started, it was yawed 180 degrees around.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:53.81,0:01:58.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后 科学号实验舱点燃了推进器 推动国际空间站
Dialogue: 2,0:01:53.81,0:01:58.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now what happens is Nauka starts to fire its thrusters to pull away from the station,
Dialogue: 1,0:01:58.41,0:02:03.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致右侧开始下降 所以空间站姿态会发生视频中所示的变化
Dialogue: 2,0:01:58.41,0:02:03.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that pulls the right side down, so it begins to pivot around like this,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:03.55,0:02:08.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,而进步号飞船和星辰号服务舱上的发动机
Dialogue: 2,0:02:03.55,0:02:08.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the engines on the Progress and Zvezda
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.33,0:02:12.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,启动并抵抗这股旋转的力量
Dialogue: 2,0:02:08.33,0:02:12.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically start to counteract this and slow the rotation down.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:12.69,0:02:17.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们这样抗衡 维持每秒半度的旋转
Dialogue: 2,0:02:12.69,0:02:17.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they keep a sort of constant rotation rate of about half a degree per second.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:17.72,0:02:23.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终停下后回到了最初的姿态
Dialogue: 2,0:02:17.72,0:02:23.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,Eventually, they stop it and they bring it all the way back around to its original orientation.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:23.94,0:02:29.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个过程持续约一个多小时 转了大概一圈半
Dialogue: 2,0:02:23.94,0:02:29.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this took like an hour or so, it completed about one and a half rotations,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.01,0:02:33.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点也得到了在任务控制中心的Zebulon Scoville的确认
Dialogue: 2,0:02:29.01,0:02:33.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this has been confirmed by mission controller Zebulon Scoville,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:33.71,0:02:37.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,事件发生时他刚好在值班
Dialogue: 2,0:02:33.71,0:02:37.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,who, uh, was there and act of during this incident.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:37.96,0:02:42.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,那为什么其他人的动画里空间站转得那么鬼畜呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:02:37.96,0:02:42.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why are people getting such wacky rotations in their animations?
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.44,0:02:44.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们回来看一下图表
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.44,0:02:44.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, let's take a look at the graph.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.44,0:02:50.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,重点先看绿线 俯仰角 最初角度大概是0
Dialogue: 2,0:02:44.44,0:02:50.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the important thing to look at is the green one, the pitch, and that basically starts at roughly zero.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.72,0:02:57.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后增长到90度后开始降低到-90
Dialogue: 2,0:02:50.72,0:02:57.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then increases until it hits 90 and then starts decreasing until it hits, well, -90.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:57.67,0:03:02.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,发生了什么？飞船不是在上下运动 而是在旋转
Dialogue: 2,0:02:57.67,0:03:02.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,Guess what? This isn't going up and down, right? This is rotating around,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.90,0:03:08.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为俯仰角的定义域就是-90到90度
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.90,0:03:08.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the pitch is being capped between 90 ... +90 and -90.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.12,0:03:12.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们再看红线和蓝线 对应滚转和偏航
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.12,0:03:12.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if you look at the red and the blue line for the roll and the pitch,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:12.42,0:03:16.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,当绿线达到90度的临界值时
Dialogue: 2,0:03:12.42,0:03:16.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the green line hits one of its 90 degree limits,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:17.09,0:03:21.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,俯仰和偏航会瞬间大幅变化 原因是……
Dialogue: 2,0:03:17.09,0:03:21.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,they flip around, they take these big transitions, and that's because ...
Dialogue: 1,0:03:21.96,0:03:27.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,空间站旋转到了角度值的奇点 懂吗？
Dialogue: 2,0:03:21.96,0:03:27.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,The space station orientation is moving what through what we call a singularity, right?
Dialogue: 1,0:03:28.17,0:03:34.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,在正负90度的时候 俯仰和偏航会变成相同的东西
Dialogue: 2,0:03:28.17,0:03:34.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,At +90 and -90, both the roll and the yaw become the same thing.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.51,0:03:39.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以此时它们会瞬间交换位置 会有一个突变
Dialogue: 2,0:03:34.51,0:03:39.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when it comes out of that, they can swap places, they can transition.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:40.12,0:03:44.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,最好的理解方法是想象你头顶正飞过一架飞机
Dialogue: 2,0:03:40.12,0:03:44.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,The the best way to think about it is if you imagine watching a plane coming towards you,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:44.71,0:03:48.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,当它向你飞来的时候 你的头会越抬越高
Dialogue: 2,0:03:44.71,0:03:48.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,and as it comes towards you, you lift your head higher and higher.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:48.34,0:03:52.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,当飞过你正上方的时候 你会突然一个很快速的转身
Dialogue: 2,0:03:48.34,0:03:52.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then as it passes over the top, you need to turn around very quickly,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:52.10,0:03:54.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,不然你会向后仰过去摔倒
Dialogue: 2,0:03:52.10,0:03:54.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you end up falling over on your back.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:54.57,0:03:58.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种情况的另一个形式就是万向锁
Dialogue: 2,0:03:54.57,0:03:58.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, the other term for this situation is gimble Lock.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:58.73,0:04:01.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是当你进行三轴旋转的时候
Dialogue: 2,0:03:58.73,0:04:01.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's basically where you have three axes of rotation,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:01.76,0:04:06.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,转到某一个位置 会让其中两轴完全重合
Dialogue: 2,0:04:01.76,0:04:06.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,and when you move to certain positions, you can end up with two of your axes aligned,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.79,0:04:09.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而失去一个自由度
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.79,0:04:09.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you lose one of your axes.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:09.02,0:04:15.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是阿波罗飞船上要非常注意的一个事情 因为他们用的就是三轴导航
Dialogue: 2,0:04:09.02,0:04:15.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course this was a big thing in flying the Apollo spacecraft, because they had three axis navigation.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:15.49,0:04:19.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果飞船指向了某个特定区域
Dialogue: 2,0:04:15.49,0:04:19.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if the spacecraft ever pointed into one of these regions,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:19.65,0:04:23.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,万向节就需要旋转无限快才能正确定向
Dialogue: 2,0:04:19.65,0:04:23.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,the gimbles would have to move infinitely fast to correctly track.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:23.60,0:04:26.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,这可能导致他们在太空中迷向 因此飞船上专门有个警报灯
Dialogue: 2,0:04:23.60,0:04:26.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they could lose orientation, so they had a warning light
Dialogue: 1,0:04:26.46,0:04:31.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,告知他们在接近万向节锁死的区域 不要靠近
Dialogue: 2,0:04:26.46,0:04:31.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,to tell them when they were getting close to these so that they didn't get into that situation.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:32.02,0:04:36.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,而偏航 俯仰和滚转都是对人来说很直观 很好理解的东西
Dialogue: 2,0:04:32.02,0:04:36.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,So and with yaw pitch and roll are shown are really, for humans, there's something that we understand,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:36.82,0:04:40.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他们数学上也叫作欧拉角
Dialogue: 2,0:04:36.82,0:04:40.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they also represent mathematically Euler angles.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:40.72,0:04:44.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,也因此 欧拉角的缺点就是存在奇点
Dialogue: 2,0:04:40.72,0:04:44.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,And yeah, Euler angles have their problems with their singularities.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:44.11,0:04:48.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此在计算机里 这些旋转通常是用四元数描述的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:44.11,0:04:48.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,Internally, they're represented by something called quaternions,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:48.14,0:04:50.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你搞过3D游戏
Dialogue: 2,0:04:48.14,0:04:50.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if you've ever made 3D video games,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:50.76,0:04:56.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可能遇到过四元数 因为它用来表示旋转非常方便
Dialogue: 2,0:04:50.76,0:04:56.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,you've probably encountered these because there are really useful ways of representing orientation.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:56.47,0:05:02.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,性质非常好 便于操作 而且没有奇点的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:04:56.47,0:05:02.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,They have all these nice properties, how you can operate on them and they don't have all these singularities.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:02.70,0:05:05.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家也可以看看视频中
Dialogue: 2,0:05:02.70,0:05:05.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you look at the video, I showed
Dialogue: 1,0:05:05.68,0:05:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,ISS的实际遥测数据 就能直接看到它用的四元数
Dialogue: 2,0:05:05.68,0:05:10.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the actual telemetry on screen, you can see the quaternions listed in there.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:10.76,0:05:16.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们的标签叫"LVLH QTRN"  结尾是0-3 一共四个数
Dialogue: 2,0:05:10.76,0:05:16.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,They show up as "LVLH QTRN", and you've got zero through three,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:16.21,0:05:17.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为是四维空间的数据
Dialogue: 2,0:05:16.21,0:05:17.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's a four dimensional number.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:17.99,0:05:21.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,就好像增加第四个万向节防止万向锁一样
Dialogue: 2,0:05:17.99,0:05:21.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just like adding a fourth gimble ring to avoid gimble lock,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:21.81,0:05:27.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,你添加一个额外的维度 就神奇地得到了这样一个性质非常好的四元数
Dialogue: 2,0:05:21.81,0:05:27.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,you add an extra dimension, and magically, you know, have this very useful set of properties.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:27.76,0:05:29.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且这背后还有一段有趣的历史
Dialogue: 2,0:05:27.76,0:05:29.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you know, this is an interesting bit of history.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:29.68,0:05:36.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,四元数是由一位叫哈密顿的物理学家 数学家发明的
Dialogue: 2,0:05:29.68,0:05:36.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,The quaternions were invented by a guy called Hamilton who was a physicist and a mathematician,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:36.47,0:05:41.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是在经典力学里“哈密顿量”的那个哈密顿 不是撞出51G的那个
Dialogue: 2,0:05:36.47,0:05:41.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you've ever encountered Hamiltonian in your classical mechanics, that's him.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:41.73,0:05:47.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,当时人们已经知道复数可以表示平面上的旋转操作
Dialogue: 2,0:05:41.73,0:05:47.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,And ... at the time, it was known that complex numbers could be used to represent rotations in a plane.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:48.09,0:05:54.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家应该也知道 复数是一个实部一个虚部 虚数单位i=√(-1)
Dialogue: 2,0:05:48.09,0:05:54.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you know how you have the real part and the complex part with the value i the square root of -1.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:55.16,0:05:59.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,而哈密顿想利用复数构造一个三维的旋转
Dialogue: 2,0:05:55.16,0:05:59.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Hamilton wanted to generalize this to three dimensional rotations.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:59.94,0:06:06.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是他一开始是一个实部+两个虚部
Dialogue: 2,0:05:59.94,0:06:06.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,So he tried to do a version with a real part and an imaginary part and a secondary imaginary part,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:06.26,0:06:10.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果数学上卡壳了 整个系统无法自洽
Dialogue: 2,0:06:06.26,0:06:10.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he could never make the math work, he could never be self consistent,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:10.36,0:06:16.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,而之后他想明白了 他需要的不是两个虚部 而是三个
Dialogue: 2,0:06:10.36,0:06:16.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he had this sort of moment of revelation that he needed three imaginary parts and one real part.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:17.27,0:06:22.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里最传奇的故事就是这灵光一闪的时刻发生时 他在都柏林布鲁姆桥上
Dialogue: 2,0:06:17.27,0:06:22.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the legend is, he had this flash of inspiration while crossing the Broome Bridge in Dublin.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:22.68,0:06:30.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以那座桥上也立了一块石碑 来纪念他发现了重要的四元数
Dialogue: 2,0:06:22.68,0:06:30.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ... that bridge actually has the equations carved into it to commemorate, it's that important.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:30.26,0:06:33.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 在当时那个时候 这只是一个小的数学结构
Dialogue: 2,0:06:30.26,0:06:33.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, at the time, they were just a mathematical construct,
Dialogue: 1,0:06:33.40,0:06:37.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,到了今天大家才发现性质非常好 有很多用处
Dialogue: 2,0:06:33.40,0:06:37.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,which had nice properties these days is essential to all sorts of applications.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:37.57,0:06:40.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多物理问题需要用到四元数来解决
Dialogue: 2,0:06:37.57,0:06:40.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are physics problems that require them to be solved.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:40.90,0:06:44.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在很多游戏制作 3D图形领域
Dialogue: 2,0:06:40.90,0:06:44.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're obviously used to make video games, 3D graphics.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:44.72,0:06:50.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,四元数通常会用来表示诸如机器人 或是航天器的旋转
Dialogue: 2,0:06:44.72,0:06:50.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're used for representing, like rotations in robots and spacecraft.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:50.85,0:06:54.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是四元数背后的一段有趣的历史
Dialogue: 2,0:06:50.85,0:06:54.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,So yeah, interesting sideline in history, there.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:54.76,0:06:58.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,结尾这里我想再给大家放一段Liam Kennedy发的视频
Dialogue: 2,0:06:54.76,0:06:58.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so I just want to end with a little bit of footage, again, compiled by Liam Kennedy.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:58.85,0:07:03.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是空间站在翻滚时拍摄地球的画面
Dialogue: 2,0:06:58.85,0:07:03.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a nadir looking camera as we pan upwards,
Dialogue: 1,0:07:03.11,0:07:07.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家能清楚看到亚洲上空城市的灯光
Dialogue: 2,0:07:03.11,0:07:07.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the great thing here is you see the city lights as they pass over Asia.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:07.78,0:07:11.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种动态的场面可不是空间站上随便能看到的
Dialogue: 2,0:07:07.78,0:07:11.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not every day you get those kind of dynamic views from the space station.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:11.62,0:07:12.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是挺有意思的！
Dialogue: 2,0:07:11.62,0:07:12.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's a good thing!
Dialogue: 1,0:07:12.84,0:07:15.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,我是Scott Manley 切记 注意飞行安全
