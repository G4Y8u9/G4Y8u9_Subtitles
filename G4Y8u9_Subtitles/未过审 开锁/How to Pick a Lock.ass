Dialogue: 2,0:01:16.00,0:01:20.52,1080EN,,0,0,0,,these all look very similar, but actually have very slight differences in size or shape
Dialogue: 1,0:01:22.64,0:01:28.04,1080CN,,0,0,0,,想要开锁，第一步是先把这个工具卡在锁的底部
Dialogue: 2,0:01:22.64,0:01:28.04,1080EN,,0,0,0,,To pick the lock, the idea is to insert one of these tension tools into the bottom of the lock here
Dialogue: 1,0:01:29.59,0:01:33.04,1080CN,,0,0,0,,然后对锁芯施加一个旋转的力量

Dialogue: 2,0:01:50.35,0:01:54.20,1080EN,,0,0,0,,You need to also be careful not to lift the lower pins above the shear line
Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.25,0:01:57.28,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为这样也会让锁芯无法转动
Dialogue: 2,0:01:54.25,0:01:57.28,1080EN,,0,0,0,,as this will also prevent the cylinder from being able to turn
Dialogue: 1,0:01:57.87,0:01:59.72,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当所有弹子都被提升到正确高度时
Dialogue: 2,0:01:57.87,0:01:59.72,1080EN,,0,0,0,,When they're all set at the correct height
Dialogue: 1,0:01:59.72,0:02:03.02,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你会感觉你最开始旋转的阻力变小
Dialogue: 2,0:01:59.72,0:02:03.02,1080EN,,0,0,0,,you should be able to feel the resistance on the torsion tool diminish
Dialogue: 1,0:02:03.16,0:02:05.98,1080CN,,0,0,0,,此时锁就能打开了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:03.16,0:02:05.98,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and now you're able to turn the cylinder and open the shackle
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.16,0:02:09.58,1080CN,,0,0,0,,技能点+1

Dialogue: 2,0:02:15.93,0:02:20.73,1080EN,,0,0,0,,but you really get a feel for what's going on, and it is possible to pick the lock quite quickly
Dialogue: 1,0:02:22.30,0:02:25.50,1080CN,,0,0,0,,如果我们转动锁芯时看锁的另一面
Dialogue: 2,0:02:22.30,0:02:25.50,1080EN,,0,0,0,,If I show you the other side of the lock as I twist the cylinder
Dialogue: 1,0:02:26.27,0:02:28.96,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你依然可以看见六个内弹子
Dialogue: 2,0:02:26.27,0:02:28.96,1080EN,,0,0,0,,again, you can see all six of the lower pins
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.79,0:02:33.40,1080CN,,0,0,0,,如果我用开锁工具在里面瞎捅，你也能看到内弹子们在上下移动
Dialogue: 2,0:02:29.79,0:02:33.40,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and if I run the pick underneath them you can see them moving up and down
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.68,0:02:47.44,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当我把锁芯转回原位时，外弹子弹回，重新锁住锁芯
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.68,0:02:47.44,1080EN,,0,0,0,,When I lined the cylinder back up, the top pins drop back, and lock in place
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.89,0:02:54.00,1080CN,,0,0,0,,尝试开这东西还是挺有趣的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:50.89,0:02:54.00,1080EN,,0,0,0,,It's a really good, fun puzzle to try and crack
Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.46,0:02:59.95,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你还可以试试一套里的其他工具，看看哪个更顺手
Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.46,0:02:59.95,1080EN,,0,0,0,,You can try out different picks, and see which one works best for you
Dialogue: 1,0:03:05.16,0:03:12.01,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当然，用透明的锁会给人一种钦定的感觉，那换个真锁试试吧
Dialogue: 2,0:03:05.16,0:03:12.01,1080EN,,0,0,0,,But of course, using a transparent lock is cheating a bit, so get yourself a real padlock, and see how you get on
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.40,0:03:26.36,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当你真打开的时候，成就感满满呀
Dialogue: 2,0:03:23.40,0:03:26.36,1080EN,,0,0,0,,When you do eventually crack it, it's really satisfying
Dialogue: 1,0:03:27.00,0:03:32.73,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你可以用之前的工具一个一个抬内弹子，还可以试试这个工具，在锁芯里乱捅
Dialogue: 2,0:03:27.00,0:03:32.73,1080EN,,0,0,0,,You can try lifting individual pins at a time, or try using a rake, like this, to rake the lock
