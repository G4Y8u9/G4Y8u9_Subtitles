Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.51,0:03:38.10,英,,0,0,0,,So for example, if you're making a turn to the left,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:38.10,0:03:42.14,中,,0,0,0,,那模拟机平台就跟着飞机向左倾斜
Dialogue: 2,0:03:38.10,0:03:42.14,英,,0,0,0,,let's just try rotating the platform to match the roll angle of the plane.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:43.07,0:03:48.41,中,,0,0,0,,表面看上去符合逻辑 但很快你就会发现这种方法存在的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:03:43.07,0:03:48.41,英,,0,0,0,,Although this seems logical, rather quickly, you'd find that this method has some problems.

Dialogue: 2,0:03:51.79,0:03:58.07,英,,0,0,0,,you may have noticed that, paradoxically, it never really feels like you're being tilted at an angle,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:58.07,0:04:02.41,中,,0,0,0,,哪怕此时飞机的滚转坡度已经达到了30度
Dialogue: 2,0:03:58.07,0:04:02.41,英,,0,0,0,,even if the aircraft is being rolled by as much as 30 degrees.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:04.22,0:04:11.23,中,,0,0,0,,这就好比以一定速度骑摩托车时 车需要向弯心倾斜一样
Dialogue: 2,0:04:04.22,0:04:11.23,英,,0,0,0,,This is similar to how you need to lean your bike towards the inside of the turn, when you're cycling at a certain speed.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:11.63,0:04:18.12,中,,0,0,0,,车速越快 或者弯道越急 为了保持平衡 滚转角度越大
Dialogue: 2,0:04:11.63,0:04:18.12,英,,0,0,0,,The faster the bike travels, or the tighter the turn, the more roll you'll need to stay balanced,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.12,0:04:20.54,中,,0,0,0,,对飞机来说也是一样道理
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.12,0:04:20.54,英,,0,0,0,,which is also the case in an aircraft.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:22.19,0:04:24.83,中,,0,0,0,,但回到我们的模拟机上来
Dialogue: 2,0:04:22.19,0:04:24.83,英,,0,0,0,,But if we look at our simulator,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:24.83,0:04:30.02,中,,0,0,0,,你会发现这并不适用 因为平台实际上并不能到处乱跑
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.83,0:04:30.02,英,,0,0,0,,you'll notice that this doesn't apply since the platform isn't actually traveling anywhere.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:30.62,0:04:35.26,中,,0,0,0,,因此 如果我们倾斜模拟机 使其与飞机的滚转坡度相匹配
Dialogue: 2,0:04:30.62,0:04:35.26,英,,0,0,0,,As a result, if we move the simulator to match the roll angle of the plane,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:35.26,0:04:38.40,中,,0,0,0,,就好比倾斜一辆完全静止的自行车
Dialogue: 2,0:04:35.26,0:04:38.40,英,,0,0,0,,it would be like tilting a bike that standing still.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:38.90,0:04:42.25,中,,0,0,0,,在重力的作用下 自行车自然会倒下
Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.90,0:04:42.25,英,,0,0,0,,Due to gravity, the bike would of course fall over.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:42.25,0:04:43.61,中,,0,0,0,,而在我们的模拟机中
Dialogue: 2,0:04:42.25,0:04:43.61,英,,0,0,0,,And in our simulator,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:43.61,0:04:49.91,中,,0,0,0,,这意味着飞行员会感受到模拟机带坡度时会有一种不真实的侧向力
Dialogue: 2,0:04:43.61,0:04:49.91,英,,0,0,0,,this means that people will feel an unrealistic side force as a consequence of the simulators roll.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:56.33,0:05:01.22,中,,0,0,0,,现在我们已经了解到 如果我们以恒定的滚转坡度进行转弯
Dialogue: 2,0:04:56.33,0:05:01.22,英,,0,0,0,,So now we've established that if we're in a coordinated turn with a constant roll angle,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:01.22,0:05:05.13,中,,0,0,0,,模拟器应该保持水平才对 很好
Dialogue: 2,0:05:01.22,0:05:05.13,英,,0,0,0,,then the simulator must stay level, which is great.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:06.80,0:05:10.06,中,,0,0,0,,那开始转弯和结束转弯怎么办?
Dialogue: 2,0:05:06.80,0:05:10.06,英,,0,0,0,,But what about when we enter and exit a turn?
Dialogue: 1,0:05:11.46,0:05:14.00,中,,0,0,0,,如果滚转角度随时间变化
Dialogue: 2,0:05:11.46,0:05:14.00,英,,0,0,0,,If the roll angle is changing over time,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:14.00,0:05:18.22,中,,0,0,0,,那么这个坡度的变化速度就称为滚转率
Dialogue: 2,0:05:14.00,0:05:18.22,英,,0,0,0,,then the rate at which this angle changes is called the roll rate.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:19.42,0:05:25.46,中,,0,0,0,,这个概念非常重要 因为人类的内耳能够感知到滚转率的变化
Dialogue: 2,0:05:19.42,0:05:25.46,英,,0,0,0,,This is important to know because your inner ear can sense when the roll rate itself changes.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:27.76,0:05:32.19,中,,0,0,0,,因此 我们确实需要模拟机跟着滚转
Dialogue: 2,0:05:27.76,0:05:32.19,英,,0,0,0,,So as it turns out, we do actually need the simulator to roll.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:32.56,0:05:35.69,中,,0,0,0,,但不能滚太多 不能倾斜太久
Dialogue: 2,0:05:32.56,0:05:35.69,英,,0,0,0,,But we can't do this too much or for too long,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:35.69,0:05:41.03,中,,0,0,0,,否则 飞行员就会开始感受到不真实的重力侧向分力
Dialogue: 2,0:05:35.69,0:05:41.03,英,,0,0,0,,because otherwise the pilots will start to feel unrealistic side forces due to gravity.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:43.75,0:05:48.68,中,,0,0,0,,为了解决这个问题 工程师们使用了"洗出滤波"算法
Dialogue: 2,0:05:43.75,0:05:48.68,英,,0,0,0,,To solve this problem, engineers use an algorithm called a washout filter,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:48.68,0:05:53.78,中,,0,0,0,,该算法将飞机的姿态变化与模拟机平台的角度联系起来
Dialogue: 2,0:05:48.68,0:05:53.78,英,,0,0,0,,which links that dynamics of the aircraft to the roll angle of the simulator platform.
