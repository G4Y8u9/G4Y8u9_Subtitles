Dialogue: 1,0:00:09.61,0:00:15.28,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你们有没有看过奥运会的射箭比赛，选手射出去后弓都会往前倒（摆弓）
Dialogue: 2,0:00:09.61,0:00:15.28,1080EN,,0,0,0,,I often get this question: why do Olympic archers drop their bows?
Dialogue: 1,0:00:15.88,0:00:22.03,1080CN,,0,0,0,,首先明确一点，不只有奥运会的反曲弓比赛会摆弓
Dialogue: 2,0:00:15.88,0:00:22.03,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Firstly it's not just the Olympic target style recurve archers that drop their bows
Dialogue: 1,0:00:22.12,0:00:26.66,1080CN,,0,0,0,,裸弓射手射标靶也会摆弓
Dialogue: 2,0:00:22.12,0:00:26.66,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Barebow target archers also drop their bows and some
Dialogue: 1,0:00:26.66,0:00:31.12,1080CN,,0,0,0,,有的复合弓射手也会，那这是为什么呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:26.66,0:00:31.12,1080EN,,0,0,0,,compound archers will do the same. Why do they do that?
Dialogue: 1,0:00:31.18,0:00:37.64,1080CN,,0,0,0,,原因很简单，射手没握住弓
Dialogue: 2,0:00:31.18,0:00:37.64,1080EN,,0,0,0,,There's a very simple explanation: they don't actually grip their bow
Dialogue: 1,0:00:37.64,0:00:42.18,1080CN,,0,0,0,,那你们肯定又奇怪了，为啥射手不想握住自己的弓呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:00:37.64,0:00:42.18,1080EN,,0,0,0,,You might be wondering: why would you not want to hold the bow?
Dialogue: 1,0:00:42.18,0:00:46.80,1080CN,,0,0,0,,你不想控制你的箭射得准吗？这就说到点子了
Dialogue: 2,0:00:42.18,0:00:46.80,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Don't you want to control it? And that's actually the point
Dialogue: 1,0:00:46.99,0:00:51.81,1080CN,,0,0,0,,紧握弓，反而会让你难以控制弓箭走向，接下来我会详细解释
Dialogue: 2,0:00:46.99,0:00:51.81,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Gripping the bow causes a loss of control and I'll show you why
Dialogue: 1,0:00:51.81,0:00:56.32,1080CN,,0,0,0,,用简易的裸弓会好解释
Dialogue: 2,0:00:51.81,0:00:56.32,1080EN,,0,0,0,,This is more apparent in a light barebow
Dialogue: 1,0:00:56.32,0:01:03.21,1080CN,,0,0,0,,许多学射箭的萌新有个坏毛病叫“死亡之握”(Death Grip)，他们会死死抓着弓不放
Dialogue: 2,0:00:56.32,0:01:03.21,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Many beginners who do archery have a habit called the death grip. They'll grip the bow really really tight
Dialogue: 1,0:01:03.21,0:01:08.82,1080CN,,0,0,0,,就像要把弓掐死一样，这在萌新阵营里非常常见
Dialogue: 2,0:01:03.21,0:01:08.82,1080EN,,0,0,0,,like choking the life out of the bow tight and you see this a lot on the line.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:08.82,0:01:15.60,1080CN,,0,0,0,,也非常正常，同时你也会看到他持弓的手一个劲发抖
Dialogue: 2,0:01:08.82,0:01:15.60,1080EN,,0,0,0,,It's quite a normal thing. You see some pull back at full draw and the hands are like white knuckles showing.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:15.93,0:01:24.44,1080CN,,0,0,0,,看上去贼紧张，结果呢？射出的箭也非常不稳定。
Dialogue: 2,0:01:15.93,0:01:24.44,1080EN,,0,0,0,,It's really tense and what happens when someone does that is that the shot becomes very shaky. 
Dialogue: 1,0:01:24.44,0:01:33.65,1080CN,,0,0,0,,手臂、手指肌肉都在用力，互相影响，你就会发抖，箭就会不稳定
Dialogue: 2,0:01:24.44,0:01:33.65,1080EN,,0,0,0,,The tendons in the fingers and the hand counteract each other and you have shake, you have torque. It's quite unstable
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.65,0:01:42.81,1080CN,,0,0,0,,反过来，如果你不那么紧紧握弓，就像比赛里那样
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.65,0:01:42.81,1080EN,,0,0,0,,The complete opposite of that is not holding a bow at all, so what you find is the Olympic style archers will do this
Dialogue: 1,0:01:42.92,0:01:50.92,1080CN,,0,0,0,,专业的射手拉弦后，持弓的手就不用握住弓，实际上手指是完全松开的
Dialogue: 2,0:01:42.92,0:01:50.92,1080EN,,0,0,0,,They'll pull the string back and they're not holding the grip at all. The fingers are in fact off the riser.
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.42,0:01:59.58,1080CN,,0,0,0,,没有之前紧握的压力，弓会很自然的紧靠你的虎口
Dialogue: 2,0:01:51.42,0:01:59.58,1080EN,,0,0,0,,With no uneven pressure on the grip what should happen is that the bow should sit naturally in the hand. 
Dialogue: 1,0:02:00.28,0:02:07.93,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这里就有个问题了，我要是就这样撒手，弓就会跟着飞出去了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:00.28,0:02:07.93,1080EN,,0,0,0,,There is a problem if I let go. The bow is going to come flying out of my hand
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.59,0:02:13.43,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以人们会使用弓绳(Sling)，有缠在手指上的，有在手腕上的
Dialogue: 2,0:02:08.59,0:02:13.43,1080EN,,0,0,0,,That is why people use slings. They can be finger slings or wrist
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.43,0:02:20.28,1080CN,,0,0,0,,作用就是连接弓和手，别让弓也飞出去
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.43,0:02:20.28,1080EN,,0,0,0,,slings and the point of the sling is to wrap around the riser so it catches the bow when it drops
Dialogue: 1,0:02:20.40,0:02:27.26,1080CN,,0,0,0,,弓就应该掉出去的。掉出去才说明你没有死死握住弓
Dialogue: 2,0:02:20.40,0:02:27.26,1080EN,,0,0,0,,The bow is meant to drop. That shows us that you're not applying any pressure on the bow
Dialogue: 1,0:02:27.42,0:02:37.17,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这点很重要，因为射手和弓有肢体接触的只有两个点，持弓的手和拉弦的手
Dialogue: 2,0:02:27.42,0:02:37.17,1080EN,,0,0,0,,This is important because for an archer, there are only 2 physical contact points: the bow grip and the drawing hand
Dialogue: 1,0:02:37.17,0:02:43.40,1080CN,,0,0,0,,多数失误也都是发生在其中某个点上
Dialogue: 2,0:02:37.17,0:02:43.40,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Most of the mistakes that happen are due to one of these factors
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.00,0:02:48.49,1080CN,,0,0,0,,当射手开始自由练习的时候，可能会有点紧张
Dialogue: 2,0:02:44.00,0:02:48.49,1080EN,,0,0,0,,When people start shooting freestyle they might get a little nervous
Dialogue: 1,0:02:48.49,0:02:55.05,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以你经常能看到有的明明戴了弓绳的射手，还在紧握弓，射的时候就像这样
Dialogue: 2,0:02:48.49,0:02:55.05,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So, you often see people, even with the finger sling on, still hold onto the grip and they'll shoot like this
Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.54,0:03:02.43,1080CN,,0,0,0,,手指还在握住弓
Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.54,0:03:02.43,1080EN,,0,0,0,,fingers still on the grip and they'll hold onto it like that
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.75,0:03:10.24,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这倒也算正常，因为其实训练一个固定的持弓姿势是有难度的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.75,0:03:10.24,1080EN,,0,0,0,,That's a fairly normal thing and it's kind of hard to train out the habit of hanging on to the bow
Dialogue: 1,0:03:10.24,0:03:16.09,1080CN,,0,0,0,,因为每次握姿都可能不太一样
Dialogue: 2,0:03:10.24,0:03:16.09,1080EN,,0,0,0,,because there is no way you can shoot with the same consistency if you're still gripping the bow
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.28,0:03:19.29,1080CN,,0,0,0,,如果你是这样射箭的，尤其想射标靶
Dialogue: 2,0:03:16.28,0:03:19.29,1080EN,,0,0,0,,If you're shooting like this, especially shooting target
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.45,0:03:23.64,1080CN,,0,0,0,,那就要学习一个，如何摆弓，让弓自然下落
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.45,0:03:23.64,1080EN,,0,0,0,,you really should be teaching yourself to let go and let it drop
Dialogue: 1,0:03:24.03,0:03:29.08,1080CN,,0,0,0,,只要你会正确使用弓绳，那弓就不会摔地上
Dialogue: 2,0:03:24.03,0:03:29.08,1080EN,,0,0,0,,As long as your sling is correctly applied the bow will not fall down
Dialogue: 1,0:03:29.28,0:03:32.32,1080CN,,0,0,0,,而如果弓在下落，那你就没做错
Dialogue: 2,0:03:29.28,0:03:32.32,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and if it does fall down then you're doing it right
Dialogue: 1,0:03:32.49,0:03:34.97,1080CN,,0,0,0,,虽然弓自己可能会不高兴
Dialogue: 2,0:03:32.49,0:03:34.97,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Unfortunately, the bow might not like you for it
Dialogue: 1,0:03:35.71,0:03:43.76,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以，正确的拉弓放箭姿势是这样的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.71,0:03:43.76,1080EN,,0,0,0,,So, a proper shot process and release and follow-through should look something like this
Dialogue: 1,0:04:12.52,0:04:16.72,1080CN,,0,0,0,,摆弓的动作有几种
Dialogue: 2,0:04:12.52,0:04:16.72,1080EN,,0,0,0,,There are several different ways people let the bow drop
Dialogue: 1,0:04:16.92,0:04:21.72,1080CN,,0,0,0,,多数射手会向前摆
Dialogue: 2,0:04:16.92,0:04:21.72,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Most archers will let the bow drop in front of them so it swings out this way
Dialogue: 1,0:04:22.01,0:04:27.42,1080CN,,0,0,0,,还有的会向外摆，或者让弓撞一下大腿
Dialogue: 2,0:04:22.01,0:04:27.42,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Other archers will let the bow swing outwards or let the bow hit their leg
Dialogue: 1,0:04:27.61,0:04:33.24,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这取决于射手的喜好，或者训练方法
Dialogue: 2,0:04:27.61,0:04:33.24,1080EN,,0,0,0,,It largely depends on several factors such as your preference or the way you were trained
Dialogue: 1,0:04:33.31,0:04:40.68,1080CN,,0,0,0,,有的人喜欢胳膊往外摆，有的喜欢往内
Dialogue: 2,0:04:33.31,0:04:40.68,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Again, some people naturally expand and swing outwards others prefer to keep it in line and swing it inwards
Dialogue: 1,0:04:41.00,0:04:49.10,1080CN,,0,0,0,,甭管哪种，最重要的一点是摆弓都必须是无意识的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:41.00,0:04:49.10,1080EN,,0,0,0,,The important thing is that the follow-through and the bow drop should not be a conscious action
Dialogue: 1,0:04:49.23,0:04:54.64,1080CN,,0,0,0,,摆弓不是在装逼，射手不是为了拍视频发B站才摆弓的
Dialogue: 2,0:04:49.23,0:04:54.64,1080EN,,0,0,0,,It's not a flair. The archers are not intentionally doing this for the camera
Dialogue: 1,0:04:54.72,0:05:00.06,1080CN,,0,0,0,,射手摆弓是因为他们没有紧握弓，这是很自然的事情
Dialogue: 2,0:04:54.72,0:05:00.06,1080EN,,0,0,0,,They're doing it because when they don't grip the bow, that's what naturally happens
Dialogue: 1,0:05:00.59,0:05:07.42,1080CN,,0,0,0,,还要就是对于裸弓来说，弓可能不会往前摆，而是往后
Dialogue: 2,0:05:00.59,0:05:07.42,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Also note that if you're shooting barebow, the bow might actually tilt backwards rather swing forwards
Dialogue: 1,0:05:07.55,0:05:12.54,1080CN,,0,0,0,,多数裸弓重心会偏后，除非你前面放很多配重
Dialogue: 2,0:05:07.55,0:05:12.54,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Most barebows tend to be back heavy unless you put on a lot of front weight. 
Dialogue: 1,0:05:12.76,0:05:20.18,1080CN,,0,0,0,,想要像电视上那样摆弓的话就得用整套配重加竞赛级反曲弓
Dialogue: 2,0:05:12.76,0:05:20.18,1080EN,,0,0,0,,The only way to get that majestic swing is if you're  using a full stabilizer setup with the Olympic recurves
Dialogue: 1,0:05:20.60,0:05:25.74,1080CN,,0,0,0,,另外，摆弓这件事并不会影响射箭本身
Dialogue: 2,0:05:20.60,0:05:25.74,1080EN,,0,0,0,,Also note that the follow-through doesn't affect the shot itself
Dialogue: 1,0:05:25.74,0:05:30.67,1080CN,,0,0,0,,就算你射箭后来个阿姆斯特朗1080度回旋加速摆弓都改变不了结果
Dialogue: 2,0:05:25.74,0:05:30.67,1080EN,,0,0,0,,It doesn't matter if you twirl it twice, do a 360 spin and brush your hair back
Dialogue: 1,0:05:30.96,0:05:37.12,1080CN,,0,0,0,,开弓都没有回头箭，你之前瞄哪就是哪
Dialogue: 2,0:05:30.96,0:05:37.12,1080EN,,0,0,0,,The arrow has already left the bow so it's going to hit where you pointed the bow at
Dialogue: 1,0:05:37.12,0:05:39.47,1080CN,,0,0,0,,跟你之后咋样没关系
Dialogue: 2,0:05:37.12,0:05:39.47,1080EN,,0,0,0,,not what you do after the shot
Dialogue: 1,0:05:39.85,0:05:46.06,1080CN,,0,0,0,,所以偶尔会看到一些射手摆弓姿势会变
Dialogue: 2,0:05:39.85,0:05:46.06,1080EN,,0,0,0,,For that reason, you may see some archers deviate from their normal follow-through
Dialogue: 1,0:05:46.20,0:05:51.53,1080CN,,0,0,0,,一些顶级射手，可能平常习惯向内摆
Dialogue: 2,0:05:46.20,0:05:51.53,1080EN,,0,0,0,,For someone who is a top-level shooter who might be always swinging inwards and twirling around
Dialogue: 1,0:05:51.72,0:05:56.03,1080CN,,0,0,0,,而某次射击却突然向外摆了
Dialogue: 2,0:05:51.72,0:05:56.03,1080EN,,0,0,0,,some shots might involve them actually popping out this way suddenly
Dialogue: 1,0:05:56.06,0:06:00.22,1080CN,,0,0,0,,这可能是因为他们后背肌肉张力发生了改变
Dialogue: 2,0:05:56.06,0:06:00.22,1080EN,,0,0,0,,and it may be because of a different level of tension in their back
Dialogue: 1,0:06:00.25,0:06:02.68,1080CN,,0,0,0,,他们当时可能是在瞄准
Dialogue: 2,0:06:00.25,0:06:02.68,1080EN,,0,0,0,,They might be forcing a shot through a certain way
Dialogue: 1,0:06:02.75,0:06:07.45,1080CN,,0,0,0,,可能在抵抗赛场上的风，但他们的目标仍然是靶心
Dialogue: 2,0:06:02.75,0:06:07.45,1080EN,,0,0,0,,They might be counteracting wind, but their shot is still on target
Dialogue: 1,0:06:07.45,0:06:11.82,1080CN,,0,0,0,,箭射出去之后怎样不重要，射手可能发现这局某些因素不太一样
Dialogue: 2,0:06:07.45,0:06:11.82,1080EN,,0,0,0,,The follow-through doesn't matter for the archer. They may have recognize that they have
Dialogue: 1,0:06:11.82,0:06:17.34,1080CN,,0,0,0,,而他们会相应的作出射箭动作上的改变
Dialogue: 2,0:06:11.82,0:06:17.34,1080EN,,0,0,0,,done something different and they will internally reflect on that shot process
Dialogue: 1,0:06:17.34,0:06:22.06,1080CN,,0,0,0,,但无论怎样，箭都是瞄着靶心射出去的，之后怎样做无所谓
Dialogue: 2,0:06:17.34,0:06:22.06,1080EN,,0,0,0,,but the shot already happened. What they do here doesn't matter
Dialogue: 1,0:06:22.57,0:06:26.67,1080CN,,0,0,0,,对于复合弓射手来说，摆弓动作就更少了
