Dialogue: 2,0:02:08.58,0:02:12.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,During the test, the engines once again sent concrete flying into the air -
Dialogue: 1,0:02:13.00,0:02:17.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当发动机关机后 一个更大的问题显现出来
Dialogue: 2,0:02:13.00,0:02:17.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,but once the engines shut down, a much bigger problem was observed.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:17.80,0:02:22.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,火箭底部能明显看到一坨坨红热的液体淌到了发射台上
Dialogue: 2,0:02:17.80,0:02:22.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the bottom of the vehicle, a glowing liquid was seen pouring out onto the launch pad.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:22.84,0:02:27.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后发现 是猛禽发动机的内部结构被完全融化了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:22.84,0:02:27.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,As it turned out, the internal components of the raptor engine had completely melted
Dialogue: 1,0:02:27.22,0:02:30.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,那些红热的液体是融化的金属
Dialogue: 2,0:02:27.22,0:02:30.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the glowing liquid was in fact molten metal.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:30.64,0:02:33.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,这类损伤发生的原因是火箭底部没有导流槽
Dialogue: 2,0:02:30.64,0:02:33.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason this kind of damage was able to happen
Dialogue: 1,0:02:33.22,0:02:36.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,这类损伤发生的原因是火箭底部没有导流槽
Dialogue: 2,0:02:33.22,0:02:36.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,is because there was no flame diverter underneath the rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:36.85,0:02:41.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是发动机的尾焰会垂直喷向水泥地
Dialogue: 2,0:02:36.85,0:02:41.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead, the force of the engines was hitting the concrete at a 90 degree angle,
Dialogue: 1,0:02:41.57,0:02:45.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,在一点产生大量的热量
Dialogue: 2,0:02:41.57,0:02:45.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,creating an enormous pressure point of heat and energy.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:45.76,0:02:50.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,但太空叉这么有经验 肯定早就预料到这件事情啦~
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.76,0:02:50.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,But surely SpaceX with their years of experience could see this problem coming.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:55.68,0:03:00.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以看来的确是因为没有导流槽才导致Starship测试出现问题
Dialogue: 2,0:02:55.68,0:03:00.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it seems like the lack of any flame diversion did cause problems for Starship.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:00.40,0:03:05.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,那为什么太空叉就是不想建这种如此重要的发射场设施呢？
Dialogue: 2,0:03:00.40,0:03:05.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why did SpaceX decide to skip this seemingly crucial part of a launch pad?
Dialogue: 1,0:03:05.60,0:03:10.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,现实的原因是Starship在博卡奇卡的这块场地还处于非常早期的设计阶段
Dialogue: 2,0:03:05.60,0:03:10.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Realistically, the Starship launch mounts in Boca Chica are still at a very early design phase
Dialogue: 1,0:03:10.88,0:03:14.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,太空叉很可能想先一步一步来 看看情况
Dialogue: 2,0:03:10.88,0:03:14.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and SpaceX are likely trying to see how much they can get away with.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:15.01,0:03:19.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且火星上不可能有现成的发射架或着陆场
Dialogue: 2,0:03:15.01,0:03:19.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, there will be no launch or landing pads on Mars,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.10,0:03:23.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以Starship需要自己应付这些问题
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.10,0:03:23.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,so Starship will need to be able to deal with debris all by itself.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.68,0:03:27.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然当前的发射场地还在建设起步阶段
Dialogue: 2,0:03:23.68,0:03:27.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Despite the current launch pads being very basic in their design,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:27.57,0:03:30.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,但Starship的发射架仍然是与我们平常见到的火箭发射台非常与众不同的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:27.57,0:03:30.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Starship's launch pad will always be extremely different
Dialogue: 1,0:03:30.78,0:03:33.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,但Starship的发射架仍然是与我们平常见到的火箭发射台非常与众不同的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:30.78,0:03:33.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the traditional launch pads we've seen in the past.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.24,0:03:37.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为Starship设计可以进行在轨燃料加注
Dialogue: 2,0:03:34.24,0:03:37.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,Since Starship is designed to do in-orbit refueling,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:38.02,0:03:41.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以所有的燃料管路都要通到火箭底部
Dialogue: 2,0:03:38.02,0:03:41.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,all of the fuel lines need to be located at the bottom of the rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:41.86,0:03:46.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而让Starship可以在太空进行交尾 并传输燃料
Dialogue: 2,0:03:41.86,0:03:46.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,This will allow Starships to dock tail-to-tail in space and transfer propellants.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:47.10,0:03:50.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,大多数火箭燃料管路会放在火箭的侧面
Dialogue: 2,0:03:47.10,0:03:50.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,On most rockets, the fuel lines are placed on the side of the rocket.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.88,0:03:54.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样火箭的管路设计会更简单一点
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.88,0:03:54.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,This allows the rocket to have a simpler design in terms of plumbing
Dialogue: 1,0:03:54.45,0:04:00.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这需要火箭侧面有更大的设备来为火箭提供燃料和电力
Dialogue: 2,0:03:54.45,0:04:00.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it requires a much larger structure at the side of the rocket to feed the vehicle with fuel and power.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:01.12,0:04:06.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于猎鹰九号火箭来说 这个东西叫“strongback”
Dialogue: 2,0:04:01.12,0:04:06.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,During a Falcon 9 launch, this structure also known as the "strongback",
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.17,0:04:10.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,它会在火箭离地后立即向后摆开
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.17,0:04:10.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,quickly pulls away from the rocket as soon as it leaves the launch pad.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:10.34,0:04:15.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而让strongback和上面的组件快速远离火箭的尾焰
Dialogue: 2,0:04:10.34,0:04:15.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,This allows the strongback and all of its components to move out of the way of the rocket's flame
Dialogue: 1,0:04:15.06,0:04:18.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,并减少后续的发射架维护工序
Dialogue: 2,0:04:15.06,0:04:18.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,and minimize the amount of refurbishment needed for the launch pad.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.78,0:04:22.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是太空叉目前另一个亟待解决的问题
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.78,0:04:22.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is yet another problem that SpaceX are looking to solve.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:22.40,0:04:25.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不但让Starship完全可复用
Dialogue: 2,0:04:22.40,0:04:25.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not only are they trying to make Starship fully reusable,

Dialogue: 2,0:04:25.50,0:04:29.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are also trying to design a fully reusable launch pad.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:29.74,0:04:32.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们打算是让Starship着陆后能在一小时内重新回到发射架上准备发射
Dialogue: 2,0:04:29.74,0:04:32.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,They want the launch pad to be so reusable,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:32.02,0:04:36.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们打算是让Starship着陆后能在一小时内重新回到发射架上准备发射
Dialogue: 2,0:04:32.02,0:04:36.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,that a Starship can land and be placed back onto the launch pad in less than an hour.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:37.30,0:04:41.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,为了达成这个目标 发射台需要能完全抵抗住Starship发动机尾焰的冲击
Dialogue: 2,0:04:37.30,0:04:41.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,In order to achieve this, the launch pad will need to be fully resistant to debris
Dialogue: 1,0:04:41.88,0:04:43.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,为了达成这个目标 发射台需要能完全抵抗住Starship发动机尾焰的冲击
