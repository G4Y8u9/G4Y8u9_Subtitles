Dialogue: 1,0:02:26.28,0:02:27.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但事情开始变得复杂了
Dialogue: 2,0:02:26.28,0:02:27.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it gets a little bit more complicated.

Dialogue: 2,0:02:31.14,0:02:37.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,It looked at the task's starting address and its priority and then passed that information to a no vac routine
Dialogue: 1,0:02:37.26,0:02:42.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,该流程会在核心集中查找程序执行的可用空间
Dialogue: 2,0:02:37.26,0:02:42.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,This scanned the core sets to see where there was any available space for the program to execute
Dialogue: 1,0:02:42.22,0:02:44.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果有的话 那存储位置在哪
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.22,0:02:44.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if so where that space was.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.54,0:02:51.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,基本上就是在核心集中找空地 把程序扔进去跑
Dialogue: 2,0:02:44.54,0:02:51.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically it found an empty space in one of those core sets and put that program set to run in that space.
Dialogue: 1,0:02:51.48,0:02:56.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,在穷举测试中 设计软件的MIT仪器实验室
Dialogue: 2,0:02:51.48,0:02:56.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,Through exhaustive testing, teams at MIT's instrumentation lab that developed the software

Dialogue: 2,0:02:56.80,0:03:00.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,came up with a way such that no core set would ever be completely filled;
Dialogue: 1,0:03:00.85,0:03:03.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而让下一个程序总能有空间运行
Dialogue: 2,0:03:00.85,0:03:03.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,there would always be a space for the next task.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:03.64,0:03:05.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且还考虑到了特殊情况
Dialogue: 2,0:03:03.64,0:03:05.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course there was also the variable
Dialogue: 1,0:03:05.41,0:03:08.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,当要运行的程序优先级比正在运行的程序优先级高时
Dialogue: 2,0:03:05.41,0:03:08.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,that if the task that needed to be done had a higher priority than one running
Dialogue: 1,0:03:08.79,0:03:13.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,计算机可以中断当前程序 运行新的程序 过后再从中断点继续运行
Dialogue: 2,0:03:08.79,0:03:13.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,it could be interrupted to run the new program and then pick back up where they left off.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:13.76,0:03:16.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以程序设计上讲是不会超载运行的
Dialogue: 2,0:03:13.76,0:03:16.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the program was never designed to be overloaded.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.54,0:03:21.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,在任务重的任何时候都有足够的核心集像并行一般运行所需程序

Dialogue: 2,0:03:21.85,0:03:24.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,could be run nearly simultaneously
Dialogue: 1,0:03:24.20,0:03:27.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者在有可用空间时按计划运行
Dialogue: 2,0:03:24.20,0:03:27.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,or else scheduled to run as soon as there was free space.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:27.26,0:03:30.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,那阿波罗11号的程序报警是哪来的？
Dialogue: 2,0:03:27.26,0:03:30.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,So where do the program alarms from the Apollo 11 mission come in?
Dialogue: 1,0:03:30.80,0:03:35.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,看上去MIT的工程师设计了不会超载的系统
Dialogue: 2,0:03:30.80,0:03:35.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well it seemed that the engineers at MIT thought they had developed a system that could not be overloaded.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:35.56,0:03:38.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,但阿波罗11号的计算机的确超载了
Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.56,0:03:38.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,But on Apollo 11 the computer did get overloaded.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:38.90,0:03:40.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,在他们准备着陆月球的时候

Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.36,0:03:47.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一种安全措施
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.36,0:03:47.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was a safety measure.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:47.90,0:03:53.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,可以在登月舱中执行中止的时候追踪到CSM的位置
Dialogue: 2,0:03:47.90,0:03:53.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,It tracked the CSM so it knew where it was in case they needed to do an abort in the lunar module.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:53.60,0:03:59.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人把雷达调整至SLEW模式 意思是只能由宇航员手动控制指向
Dialogue: 2,0:03:53.60,0:03:59.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,The crew left the radar on in slew mode meaning it had to be manually positioned by an astronaut
Dialogue: 1,0:03:59.00,0:04:02.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时它也不会向计算机发送数据
Dialogue: 2,0:03:59.00,0:04:02.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this also meant that it wasn't sending data to the computer.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:02.18,0:04:06.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,但几位宇航员和任务控制中心的人们都不知道的是
Dialogue: 2,0:04:02.18,0:04:06.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what neither the astronauts nor the guys in Mission Control knew was that
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.20,0:04:11.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,雷达耦合数据单元当时在向阿波罗制导计算机发送大量计数器中断信号
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.20,0:04:11.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,radar coupling data units were flooding the Apollo guidance computer with counter interrupt signals.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:11.68,0:04:15.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,原因是计算机电源结构设计的疏忽
Dialogue: 2,0:04:11.68,0:04:15.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was due to an oversight in the computer's power supply design structure.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:15.92,0:04:19.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些信号占用了计算机处理时间的一小部分
Dialogue: 2,0:04:15.92,0:04:19.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,These signals were taking up just a little bit of the computer's processing time
Dialogue: 1,0:04:19.85,0:04:22.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致后台在持续运行这些错误的程序
Dialogue: 2,0:04:19.85,0:04:22.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the spurious job kept running in the background.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:22.76,0:04:28.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,而大家都不知道的是 这个信号会让登月相关的重要程序无法执行
Dialogue: 2,0:04:22.76,0:04:28.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,So unbeknownst to anyone, this signal prevented vital programs associated with the landing from completing.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:28.68,0:04:32.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以新来的程序送到计算机 发现没有地方执行
Dialogue: 2,0:04:28.68,0:04:32.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when a new task was sent to the computer, there was nowhere for it to go.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:32.96,0:04:37.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,正在运行和准备运行的程序占满了核心集和矢量累加存储区
Dialogue: 2,0:04:32.96,0:04:37.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,The running and scheduled jobs were holding their core set and their vac areas.
