Dialogue: 1,0:01:12.09,0:01:17.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后生还者 第II章以乔尔讲述第一部作品的结尾开场
Dialogue: 1,0:01:17.58,0:01:20.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,镜头聚焦在吉他的指板上
Dialogue: 1,0:01:20.34,0:01:23.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,上面有个非常明显的标识 这在后来非常重要
Dialogue: 1,0:01:23.91,0:01:27.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,我希望大家能把这个画面印在脑海中
Dialogue: 1,0:01:27.25,0:01:30.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我们将在整个游戏结束后再次回到这里
Dialogue: 1,0:01:30.60,0:01:33.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这段乔尔与汤米的对话中
Dialogue: 1,0:01:33.81,0:01:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔解释了他选择去救艾莉而放弃全人类的决定
Dialogue: 1,0:01:38.37,0:01:43.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,其实光是这一点 在初代游戏发布的时候就有不少争议
Dialogue: 1,0:01:43.86,0:01:45.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,在第一部作品的结尾
Dialogue: 1,0:01:45.42,0:01:50.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,就有很多人在问火萤组织到底是否有能力研发疫苗
Dialogue: 1,0:01:50.91,0:01:55.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是很多人认为乔尔的行为非常合理的原因之一
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.32,0:01:58.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,不只在于他拯救了艾莉 他的“女儿”一样的角色
Dialogue: 1,0:01:58.89,0:02:02.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,更在于他不想牺牲艾莉的生命
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.78,0:02:07.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,去搏一个不太可能成功的概率
Dialogue: 1,0:02:07.14,0:02:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟在一代里 火萤组织还是挺废物的
Dialogue: 1,0:02:11.52,0:02:14.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们雇了一个编外人员
Dialogue: 1,0:02:14.67,0:02:19.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,将可能是有史以来对人类最重要的人——艾莉
Dialogue: 1,0:02:19.29,0:02:24.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,一路横跨美国送到了目的地 以希望自己能研发出疫苗
Dialogue: 1,0:02:24.21,0:02:28.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当你在一代作品结尾到了目的地 在医院探索的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:02:28.38,0:02:31.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会发现整个流程中的很多医生对这件事情能否成功都心里没底
Dialogue: 1,0:02:31.76,0:02:34.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会发现整个流程中的很多医生对这件事情能否成功都心里没底
Dialogue: 1,0:02:34.68,0:02:39.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟这间医院里的每个人都从来没有针对这样一种真菌研发疫苗的经验
Dialogue: 1,0:02:39.35,0:02:46.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟这间医院里的每个人都从来没有针对这样一种真菌研发疫苗的经验
Dialogue: 1,0:02:46.29,0:02:49.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,但火萤这边认为至少机会是有的
Dialogue: 1,0:02:49.73,0:02:50.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果让艾莉跑了
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.88,0:02:54.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,火萤连她大脑里的任何抗体
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.01,0:02:59.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者管他什么能让她在被感染者咬到后还能生还的东西都没提取过
Dialogue: 1,0:02:59.25,0:03:02.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,那他们就永远不会造出疫苗了
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.88,0:03:07.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果他们给艾莉开颅 并至少研发出某种疫苗
Dialogue: 1,0:03:07.62,0:03:09.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,那机会就总是有的
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.15,0:03:11.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而在续作的开头
Dialogue: 1,0:03:11.97,0:03:14.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们看到乔尔很自信
Dialogue: 1,0:03:14.39,0:03:18.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,认为火萤组织在尝试研发疫苗 而且认为他们是有能力做到的
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.60,0:03:19.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,但代价是艾莉的生命
Dialogue: 1,0:03:19.95,0:03:24.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为是汤米的表情为玩家对乔尔的决定应该有的感觉定下了基调
Dialogue: 1,0:03:24.44,0:03:27.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为是汤米的表情为玩家对乔尔的决定应该有的感觉定下了基调
Dialogue: 1,0:03:27.87,0:03:33.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,他惊呆了 但同时又不能责怪乔尔做出的选择
Dialogue: 1,0:03:33.45,0:03:36.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟在这段开场的过后
Dialogue: 1,0:03:36.96,0:03:40.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米对乔尔说他也会做出同样的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:03:40.56,0:03:46.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 这样的游戏开场安排非常非常重要
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.14,0:03:50.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗的编剧们希望提醒玩家乔尔都做过哪些事
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.55,0:03:56.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,并以此为之后的所有叙事内容做好铺垫
Dialogue: 1,0:03:57.04,0:04:01.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这段对话过后 汤米还是不知该作何反应
Dialogue: 1,0:04:01.26,0:04:05.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是告诉乔尔上马 回镇子里
Dialogue: 1,0:04:05.31,0:04:08.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,说明汤米花了一点时间才得出结论
Dialogue: 1,0:04:08.40,0:04:12.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时也给了玩家一点时间进入这个世界
Dialogue: 1,0:04:12.93,0:04:15.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,许多游戏会在续作中急于求成
Dialogue: 1,0:04:15.54,0:04:19.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,开篇给玩家灌输大量新鲜不同的内容
Dialogue: 1,0:04:19.05,0:04:21.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这些内容可能只有在第一部作品的梦中才能见到
Dialogue: 1,0:04:21.87,0:04:25.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而谢天谢地 顽皮狗没有这样做
Dialogue: 1,0:04:25.35,0:04:28.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们把背景一步一步构建起来
Dialogue: 1,0:04:28.29,0:04:30.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这点做的非常好
Dialogue: 1,0:04:30.66,0:04:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家骑马穿过一段美丽的场景前往杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,0:04:33.87,0:04:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,此时 玩家首次能够一览杰克逊小镇全貌
Dialogue: 1,0:04:38.37,0:04:41.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,在一代结尾中我们只瞥见了小镇的一隅
Dialogue: 1,0:04:41.31,0:04:42.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,其余只能靠自己想象
Dialogue: 1,0:04:42.86,0:04:44.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来就是顽皮狗表演的时间
Dialogue: 1,0:04:44.67,0:04:51.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段开篇是我在所有游戏中见过的最写实的城市之一
Dialogue: 1,0:04:51.57,0:04:53.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的太棒了
Dialogue: 1,0:04:53.52,0:05:01.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,每个NPC 每个动画 每座建筑 每个雪中的脚印都细致入微 栩栩如生
Dialogue: 1,0:05:01.62,0:05:03.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,就其沉浸感而言
Dialogue: 1,0:05:03.48,0:05:08.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这是有史以来做得最强的游戏之一
Dialogue: 1,0:05:08.60,0:05:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,当玩家进入小镇内部
Dialogue: 1,0:05:10.53,0:05:16.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人下马 汤米提出要帮乔尔把马带回马厩
Dialogue: 1,0:05:16.26,0:05:19.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,并对乔尔承诺把这个真相带到坟墓里去
Dialogue: 1,0:05:19.35,0:05:21.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,这暗示了很多内容
Dialogue: 1,0:05:21.06,0:05:24.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,其一 他好像意思是要瞒着艾莉这件事情
Dialogue: 1,0:05:24.20,0:05:28.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为如果艾莉发现了这个真相 会带来相当多的麻烦
Dialogue: 1,0:05:28.74,0:05:31.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟 从艾莉的角度来看
Dialogue: 1,0:05:31.08,0:05:35.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔只是在她做完一堆测试之后就出来了
Dialogue: 1,0:05:35.40,0:05:40.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,而自己也很明显无法提供任何对疫苗研发有用的帮助
Dialogue: 1,0:05:40.77,0:05:42.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,在一代游戏结尾
Dialogue: 1,0:05:42.03,0:05:45.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,很明显艾莉也看出了乔尔在撒谎
Dialogue: 1,0:05:45.54,0:05:48.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者至少她认为这里面还有其他故事
Dialogue: 1,0:05:48.84,0:05:52.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,但碍于两人关系 她还是相信了他
Dialogue: 1,0:05:52.14,0:05:54.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而我认为这里还在暗示另一件事情
Dialogue: 1,0:05:54.78,0:05:59.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,即如果小镇中其他人知道乔尔所做的事
Dialogue: 1,0:05:59.19,0:06:01.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我认为他们不会像汤米那样理解乔尔的行为
Dialogue: 1,0:06:01.62,0:06:06.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然我们可以坐下来唠一天一宿说一代里的火萤组织有多废柴
Dialogue: 1,0:06:06.21,0:06:08.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这也的确是个需要讨论的问题
Dialogue: 1,0:06:08.31,0:06:11.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,要让我把人类的命运托付给他们
Dialogue: 1,0:06:11.46,0:06:14.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,那还不如指望小行星撞地球一了百了
Dialogue: 1,0:06:14.28,0:06:18.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,而其实我想说的是 顽皮狗在讲述一个故事
Dialogue: 1,0:06:18.24,0:06:22.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们在引导玩家以他们想要的方式来看待乔尔这个角色
Dialogue: 1,0:06:22.47,0:06:24.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,就故事情节而言
Dialogue: 1,0:06:24.15,0:06:28.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们需要知道火萤组织才是尝试拯救人类的角色
Dialogue: 1,0:06:28.84,0:06:36.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们才在疫苗研发的前沿 他们最有希望能够拯救无数的生命
Dialogue: 1,0:06:36.06,0:06:40.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时 仍然是就TLOU2的故事情节而言
Dialogue: 1,0:06:40.84,0:06:43.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔才是告吹这件事的元凶
Dialogue: 1,0:06:43.52,0:06:49.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为如果艾莉死在了手术刀下 那至少还会有出现疫苗的机会
Dialogue: 1,0:06:49.68,0:06:55.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔杀死了要给艾莉做手术 尝试研发疫苗的医生
Dialogue: 1,0:06:55.71,0:06:58.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,表面上拯救了他的“女儿”一样的角色
Dialogue: 1,0:06:58.23,0:07:02.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,但却毁了整个人类的未来
Dialogue: 1,0:07:02.67,0:07:06.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说 他这是在丢西瓜捡芝麻
Dialogue: 1,0:07:06.39,0:07:11.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,他用一个看似较小的恶换取一个大得多的恶
Dialogue: 1,0:07:11.31,0:07:17.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,他这样做是因为他的判断被自己的个人愿望和意志所蒙蔽
Dialogue: 1,0:07:17.10,0:07:23.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,这并不是说在这个场景中 乔尔可能或者已经对这些感到后悔
Dialogue: 1,0:07:23.13,0:07:26.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是说游戏希望玩家从现在开始认真思考
Dialogue: 1,0:07:26.44,0:07:32.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔的行为是否是合理的 甚至于这件事是否是正义的
Dialogue: 1,0:07:32.31,0:07:32.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过不用急
Dialogue: 1,0:07:32.99,0:07:38.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗会带你不断回忆艾莉在杰克逊小镇长大的经历 从而帮你思考这个问题
Dialogue: 1,0:07:38.39,0:07:41.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗会带你不断回忆艾莉在杰克逊小镇长大的经历 从而帮你思考这个问题
Dialogue: 1,0:07:41.25,0:07:43.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我保证在你知道答案之前
Dialogue: 1,0:07:43.05,0:07:46.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,你甚至会相信乔尔实际上是个反派
Dialogue: 1,0:07:46.74,0:07:52.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不是希望玩家都去恨他或者想让他死
Dialogue: 1,0:07:52.65,0:07:56.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是让大家知道 乔尔才是毁灭人类前途的人
Dialogue: 1,0:07:56.76,0:08:03.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你跟别人说有人为了某一个人而毁灭整个人类的命运
Dialogue: 1,0:08:03.90,0:08:06.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我们只是可能会说他是个坏人
Dialogue: 1,0:08:06.00,0:08:08.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者甚至不一定是坏
Dialogue: 1,0:08:08.64,0:08:13.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能单纯说他是个不理智的 或者可能是被误解的 动机很复杂的人
Dialogue: 1,0:08:13.56,0:08:15.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能单纯说他是个不理智的 或者可能是被误解的 动机很复杂的人
Dialogue: 1,0:08:15.90,0:08:20.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,重点在于 人不是非好即恶的
Dialogue: 1,0:08:20.94,0:08:23.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,事情不是非黑即白的
Dialogue: 1,0:08:23.19,0:08:28.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来这段开场情节是在乔尔刚到后不久 艾莉还很年轻
Dialogue: 1,0:08:28.83,0:08:34.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,她住在房子后面的附属房里 房子大概是乔尔的
Dialogue: 1,0:08:34.53,0:08:36.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,女孩有自己的小天地是件很温馨的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:08:36.60,0:08:41.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这还是向我们透露了很多两人关系的信息
Dialogue: 1,0:08:41.90,0:08:46.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然 乔尔这样一个中年大叔遇到了这个小女孩
Dialogue: 1,0:08:46.62,0:08:49.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,带她横穿了整个美国
Dialogue: 1,0:08:49.32,0:08:51.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,把她从食人族里救出来
Dialogue: 1,0:08:51.57,0:08:56.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在两人回到了乔尔弟弟和嫂子运营的小镇里
Dialogue: 1,0:08:56.67,0:09:01.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,可以认为艾莉住在乔尔家是还算合适的
Dialogue: 1,0:09:01.71,0:09:03.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得重点不在此
Dialogue: 1,0:09:03.78,0:09:08.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔是艾莉的“父亲”角色 我觉得这没什么争议
Dialogue: 1,0:09:08.58,0:09:15.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,而艾莉希望和乔尔保持距离这件事则有很深的含义
Dialogue: 1,0:09:15.75,0:09:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 玩家可以看到艾莉正在画画
Dialogue: 1,0:09:18.59,0:09:21.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,她画的东西会在游戏后来内容中反复出现
Dialogue: 1,0:09:21.27,0:09:25.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉实际上很有艺术天赋
Dialogue: 1,0:09:25.05,0:09:29.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,从游戏全程都能随时翻看的笔记本中玩家就能发现这点
Dialogue: 1,0:09:29.34,0:09:33.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,她经常把她看到的不同事物画下来
Dialogue: 1,0:09:33.67,0:09:36.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而帮助自己回忆起那个地方
Dialogue: 1,0:09:36.52,0:09:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,抑或是单纯地记录主线故事的事件
Dialogue: 1,0:09:41.40,0:09:44.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔进来时她正在听音乐
Dialogue: 1,0:09:44.01,0:09:48.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,气氛可爱得有点尬 但又甜得掉牙
Dialogue: 1,0:09:48.99,0:09:52.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家都能看出这里的气氛有些紧张
Dialogue: 1,0:09:52.83,0:09:57.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔站也不自在 坐也不自在 讲话有一搭没一搭地聊着艾莉的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:09:57.15,0:09:59.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,而艾莉也发现了这一点
Dialogue: 1,0:09:59.64,0:10:01.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以气氛真的很紧张
Dialogue: 1,0:10:01.71,0:10:05.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们都知道犹他州的问题还没有解决
Dialogue: 1,0:10:05.94,0:10:08.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,但都不知道如何去展开这个话题
Dialogue: 1,0:10:08.16,0:10:10.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以两人只是简单地敷衍攀谈
Dialogue: 1,0:10:10.56,0:10:16.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这一段情节的重点是乔尔要表达艾莉在他的生活中是多么重要
Dialogue: 1,0:10:16.68,0:10:21.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,让我们花些时间放松一下 用心感受接下来这段场景的美
Dialogue: 1,0:10:21.51,0:10:24.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及艾莉极具个人特色的回复
Dialogue: 1,0:11:53.46,0:11:55.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用我来提醒大家
Dialogue: 1,0:11:55.02,0:11:59.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,这首歌将要在主线故事中一次又一次地出现
Dialogue: 1,0:11:59.31,0:12:01.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以请大家务必记好
Dialogue: 1,0:12:01.53,0:12:05.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得也用不着提醒 毕竟这歌动听到你可能这辈子都忘不掉
Dialogue: 1,0:12:05.91,0:12:08.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得也用不着提醒 毕竟这歌动听到你可能这辈子都忘不掉
Dialogue: 1,0:12:08.66,0:12:11.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外一个有趣的知识点是 在编剧尼尔·德鲁克曼的推特里
Dialogue: 1,0:12:11.94,0:12:16.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人都问过他为什么这首Pearl Jam的歌曲《Future Days》会出现在游戏中
Dialogue: 1,0:12:16.04,0:12:19.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人都问过他为什么这首Pearl Jam的歌曲《Future Days》会出现在游戏中
Dialogue: 1,0:12:19.11,0:12:25.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家问这个问题的原因是这首歌在2013年10月才正式公开
Dialogue: 1,0:12:25.05,0:12:28.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这是在TLOU的世界观中疫情爆发后一个月的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:12:28.80,0:12:32.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这首歌是不应该出现的
Dialogue: 1,0:12:32.06,0:12:33.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,尼尔·德鲁克曼回应说
Dialogue: 1,0:12:40.83,0:12:43.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至还有YouTube的链接
Dialogue: 1,0:12:43.14,0:12:45.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且Pearl Jam也的确参演了这场Live
Dialogue: 1,0:12:45.81,0:12:51.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,而该视频发布于2013年7月26日
Dialogue: 1,0:12:51.06,0:12:53.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,也的确是视频的发布时间
Dialogue: 1,0:12:53.25,0:12:58.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是顽皮狗专注于细节的一个完美例子
Dialogue: 1,0:12:58.59,0:13:05.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得就算这首歌是在游戏中疫情爆发后三年才发布也不会有人较真此事
Dialogue: 1,0:13:05.73,0:13:11.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,但实际上 顽皮狗自己找到了符合游戏情感基调的歌曲
Dialogue: 1,0:13:11.44,0:13:15.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,完美匹配乔尔和艾莉的关系
Dialogue: 1,0:13:15.39,0:13:19.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后回头去确认这首歌的时间线符合游戏的内容
Dialogue: 1,0:13:19.71,0:13:21.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,太不可思议了
Dialogue: 1,0:13:21.15,0:13:25.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也再次证明了顽皮狗的完美主义
Dialogue: 1,0:13:25.23,0:13:28.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们完全没必要在意这些小事 但他们的确在意
Dialogue: 1,0:13:28.53,0:13:32.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也让顽皮狗成为独一无二的制作组 无论你喜不喜欢他们
Dialogue: 1,0:13:32.19,0:13:36.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这段温馨的闪回过后 镜头切到起晚了的艾莉
Dialogue: 1,0:13:36.00,0:13:39.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,一位我们之后在游戏中会讲到的角色——杰西
Dialogue: 1,0:13:39.53,0:13:42.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,咣咣咣敲门吵醒了艾莉
Dialogue: 1,0:13:42.44,0:13:46.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,在接下来的十分钟里 当你漫步经过这个小镇时
Dialogue: 1,0:13:46.08,0:13:51.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会亲身感受2018年E3预告片里的各种内容
Dialogue: 1,0:13:51.60,0:13:53.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我发现比较有趣的一点是
Dialogue: 1,0:13:53.49,0:13:57.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,那段蒂娜和艾莉首次接吻的镜头
Dialogue: 1,0:13:57.87,0:14:00.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,我本以为会是一段非常重要的场景
Dialogue: 1,0:14:00.78,0:14:04.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,但顽皮狗却并没有展现给玩家 至少现在还没有
Dialogue: 1,0:14:04.41,0:14:08.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,取而代之的是两人用对话叙述了发生的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:14:08.28,0:14:09.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,但玩到这我不禁发现
Dialogue: 1,0:14:09.48,0:14:15.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是第一个预告片对游戏本身的背景把握起重要作用的例子
Dialogue: 1,0:14:15.45,0:14:17.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为在这个场景中
Dialogue: 1,0:14:17.28,0:14:21.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人谈论的画面在游戏结束前15分钟以前 一直没有直接展现给玩家
Dialogue: 1,0:14:21.71,0:14:24.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人谈论的画面在游戏结束前15分钟以前 一直没有直接展现给玩家
Dialogue: 1,0:14:24.79,0:14:32.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,之前预告片展示的东西要么多次大幅改变 要么改变位置
Dialogue: 1,0:14:32.09,0:14:37.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致你必须看过预告片才能真正理解发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,0:14:37.99,0:14:42.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然我觉得这不算是一件令人困扰的大事
Dialogue: 1,0:14:42.07,0:14:46.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟绝大多数买了游戏的人可能都看过预告片
Dialogue: 1,0:14:46.80,0:14:51.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我仍然觉得在预告片中展示一个场景
Dialogue: 1,0:14:51.06,0:14:54.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,却在游戏正作中只让角色讨论此事而不展示 是一件奇怪的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:14:54.87,0:14:57.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这在这部游戏中发生过很多次
Dialogue: 1,0:14:57.12,0:15:01.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗会拿出一段内容 切成十几段
Dialogue: 1,0:15:01.22,0:15:05.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后随机分散在整部游戏故事当中
Dialogue: 1,0:15:05.04,0:15:07.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,有时我会想这可能有助于叙事节奏
Dialogue: 1,0:15:07.04,0:15:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这可以让玩家从非常紧张焦灼的游戏中解脱出来
Dialogue: 1,0:15:11.52,0:15:15.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,但更多的时候这样的处理会让人感觉突兀
Dialogue: 1,0:15:15.75,0:15:21.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用着急 我们在故事的后面会讲到一些这样的反面例子
Dialogue: 1,0:15:21.30,0:15:26.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之大家要知道的就是艾莉和蒂娜两人第一次亲吻了对方
Dialogue: 1,0:15:26.13,0:15:32.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们刚刚遇到的这位角色说了些不太好听的、偏执的话
Dialogue: 1,0:15:32.73,0:15:35.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且大家也都希望你能知道他说的话太偏执了
Dialogue: 1,0:15:35.61,0:15:40.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后人家给你一些三明治作为赔礼 你就收拾出发巡逻去了
Dialogue: 1,0:15:40.11,0:15:43.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家还要知道的是 杰西刚刚和蒂娜分手不久
Dialogue: 1,0:15:43.64,0:15:48.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,发生在大约7到10天之前
Dialogue: 1,0:15:48.32,0:15:52.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能是蒂娜提的分手 也可能是俩人各走各的
Dialogue: 1,0:15:52.05,0:15:57.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也不太懂这些……男男女女卿卿我我这些……可太痛苦了
Dialogue: 1,0:15:57.51,0:16:02.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰西先去马厩准备巡逻用的马匹和家伙事
Dialogue: 1,0:16:02.16,0:16:06.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,而蒂娜与艾莉和一帮小屁孩打了一场雪仗
Dialogue: 1,0:16:06.52,0:16:09.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人感觉这段雪仗怪怪的
Dialogue: 1,0:16:09.47,0:16:14.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为它设计明显是作为战斗教学用的
Dialogue: 1,0:16:14.37,0:16:19.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然也可能是我过度解读了 因为我感觉这段教学做的并不好
Dialogue: 1,0:16:19.38,0:16:22.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,我后来还玩了二周目
Dialogue: 1,0:16:22.17,0:16:27.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,选择“新游戏+” 困难难度
Dialogue: 1,0:16:27.39,0:16:32.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,在玩过整部游戏对操作完全熟悉之后
Dialogue: 1,0:16:32.07,0:16:37.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,这场雪仗就感觉比我第一次玩时候的体验要有意思多了
Dialogue: 1,0:16:37.15,0:16:39.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这场雪仗就感觉比我第一次玩时候的体验要有意思多了
Dialogue: 1,0:16:39.12,0:16:43.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,本作中艾莉有三种姿态 分别是站立 蹲下和匍匐
Dialogue: 1,0:16:43.90,0:16:46.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这需要一点时间来适应
Dialogue: 1,0:16:46.47,0:16:51.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然说很多第三人称游戏和第一人称射击游戏都有这三个动作
Dialogue: 1,0:16:51.90,0:16:53.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然说很多第三人称游戏和第一人称射击游戏都有这三个动作
Dialogue: 1,0:16:53.85,0:16:59.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在TLOU2中 这三个动作会衍生出大量其他动作
Dialogue: 1,0:16:59.25,0:17:00.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也正是我觉得奇怪的点
Dialogue: 1,0:17:00.48,0:17:05.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段游戏内容并没有充分介绍游戏角色的这三种动作
Dialogue: 1,0:17:05.58,0:17:10.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,但却可以在这段游戏场景中使用它们
Dialogue: 1,0:17:10.32,0:17:11.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以看起来就有点不搭调
Dialogue: 1,0:17:11.79,0:17:15.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是要承认他们在这段场景中付出的努力
Dialogue: 1,0:17:15.56,0:17:18.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为还是要比其他游戏的新手教学强多了
Dialogue: 1,0:17:18.45,0:17:22.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用像大家刻板印象里那样主角学习瞄准射击
Dialogue: 1,0:17:22.68,0:17:26.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用像大家刻板印象里那样主角学习瞄准射击
Dialogue: 1,0:17:26.58,0:17:31.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,还要射瓶瓶罐罐一些东西……我可烦死这些了
Dialogue: 1,0:17:31.35,0:17:36.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得最反面典型的就是辐射3开场拿着BB枪那段
Dialogue: 1,0:17:36.57,0:17:41.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,下楼拿枪射一些目标 还爬出来几只巨型蟑螂
Dialogue: 1,0:17:41.94,0:17:44.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这太离谱了
Dialogue: 1,0:17:44.46,0:17:47.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,你如果想向玩家介绍射击和战斗系统
Dialogue: 1,0:17:47.58,0:17:50.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你好歹得稍微加一点点创意进去
Dialogue: 1,0:17:50.94,0:17:56.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此我还是很欣赏TLOU2里和孩子们打雪仗的这段内容
Dialogue: 1,0:17:56.00,0:17:58.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩了一身雪之后你和蒂娜一起去了马厩
Dialogue: 1,0:17:58.98,0:18:03.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后又是一些尴尬得让艾莉很难接的对话……
Dialogue: 1,0:18:03.36,0:18:05.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 我都不懂这些的
Dialogue: 1,0:18:05.34,0:18:09.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后两人走出马厩开始了巡逻
Dialogue: 1,0:18:09.00,0:18:12.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后游戏的第一个惊喜就扑面而来了
Dialogue: 1,0:18:12.33,0:18:15.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,说实话我觉得即使对于被提前剧透的玩家来说也够惊喜的
Dialogue: 1,0:18:15.99,0:18:20.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,镜头缓缓从几个睡觉的青年人上方略过
Dialogue: 1,0:18:20.67,0:18:22.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终定格在一个女孩身上
Dialogue: 1,0:18:22.32,0:18:27.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多玩家一下就认出了她是2017年巴黎游戏周上预告片里的主角
Dialogue: 1,0:18:27.93,0:18:31.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,她起来后和一个年轻男子聊了几句 男子说要给她看些东西
Dialogue: 1,0:18:31.53,0:18:34.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们就开始控制她了
Dialogue: 1,0:18:34.02,0:18:36.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,我之前说过 我也是玩游戏前就被剧透了的
Dialogue: 1,0:18:36.75,0:18:44.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这些剧透说的都是你将要从游戏中间开始到结束的后半段里控制埃比
Dialogue: 1,0:18:44.34,0:18:48.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,我完全没想到会在游戏开始半小时到45分钟内就能操控她
Dialogue: 1,0:18:48.81,0:18:52.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,我敢说这时候可能就已经有一些人不玩了
Dialogue: 1,0:18:52.05,0:19:00.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟总有个别少数人说这代整个游戏要是不操控乔尔和艾莉就把盘掰了
Dialogue: 1,0:19:00.12,0:19:06.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这里要知道的关键是 玩家必须在游戏上投入时间和精力 来让游戏证明自己
Dialogue: 1,0:19:06.51,0:19:10.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,就好像你不能单纯从一本书的封面或者一部电影的预告来做出判断一样
Dialogue: 1,0:19:10.29,0:19:14.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,不试试的话你永远无法给出对这部游戏的客观看法
Dialogue: 1,0:19:14.91,0:19:19.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,这并不是说你必须把每个游戏都玩一遍才能对每一个游戏有看法
Dialogue: 1,0:19:19.29,0:19:24.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是说如果你对一个游戏有极其消极或批评的看法
Dialogue: 1,0:19:24.18,0:19:26.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,你首先必须要有合理的自证
Dialogue: 1,0:19:26.91,0:19:31.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 游玩游戏封面上没有的角色
Dialogue: 1,0:19:31.44,0:19:37.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,就说这游戏不好不值得浪费时间 是一件不公平的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:19:37.07,0:19:40.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,在开始操控埃比后 你穿过树林
Dialogue: 1,0:19:40.77,0:19:43.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,踩过深深的积雪
Dialogue: 1,0:19:43.08,0:19:45.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,看到了一些不错的景色
Dialogue: 1,0:19:45.27,0:19:48.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,俩人聊了聊团队里的其他人
Dialogue: 1,0:19:48.93,0:19:51.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,很可能就是刚刚镜头扫过的那几位
Dialogue: 1,0:19:51.65,0:19:56.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在的情况是这些人玩家一个都不认识 而顽皮狗经常玩这一套
Dialogue: 1,0:19:56.31,0:20:00.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们觉得可以插入一些毫无解释的突兀的对话
Dialogue: 1,0:20:00.18,0:20:03.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,角色们会自己进行他们看起来可能合理的对话
Dialogue: 1,0:20:03.21,0:20:08.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能是不合理的对话 甚至对玩家来讲完全离谱的对话
Dialogue: 1,0:20:08.82,0:20:10.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,我其实很喜欢这点
Dialogue: 1,0:20:10.08,0:20:15.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然我承认对于更喜欢被动接受对话内容的玩家来说这可能会很迷惑
Dialogue: 1,0:20:15.67,0:20:17.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这是一部叙事导向的游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:20:17.55,0:20:21.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多这类游戏的对话看起来都是这样的
Dialogue: 1,0:20:21.54,0:20:23.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,这让角色更加真实 更加接地气
Dialogue: 1,0:20:23.36,0:20:26.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,而不是一股脑把对话和信息塞给你
Dialogue: 1,0:20:26.70,0:20:32.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外我一定要告诉大家 二周目再看这些对话的时候体验真的棒极了
Dialogue: 1,0:20:32.35,0:20:34.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 他们讨论的每一件事
Dialogue: 1,0:20:34.86,0:20:38.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,都是合理的、前后相关联的
Dialogue: 1,0:20:38.24,0:20:42.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,当你通关一次 见过了所有这些角色
Dialogue: 1,0:20:42.12,0:20:46.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,认识了他们 并随着故事流程慢慢开始关心他们
Dialogue: 1,0:20:46.62,0:20:51.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,作为一个测评游戏前至少要通关两次的人
Dialogue: 1,0:20:51.72,0:20:54.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真的很喜欢这样的对话设计
Dialogue: 1,0:20:54.18,0:20:59.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此我在二周目里获得了更多的信息 对剧情也更加感兴趣
Dialogue: 1,0:20:59.78,0:21:03.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 我强烈建议大家试试玩玩二周目
Dialogue: 1,0:21:03.72,0:21:08.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会惊讶自己之前竟然错过如此多的细节
Dialogue: 1,0:21:08.64,0:21:10.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对于第一次玩来说
Dialogue: 1,0:21:10.48,0:21:15.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们要记住这两个人的名字 女的叫埃比 男的叫欧文
Dialogue: 1,0:21:15.18,0:21:18.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们看上去曾有过一段感情经历
Dialogue: 1,0:21:18.15,0:21:23.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说 俩人之前曾经有过一段浪漫的爱情
Dialogue: 1,0:21:23.07,0:21:30.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外 那位现在和欧文在一起的 叫梅尔的女子 怀孕了
Dialogue: 1,0:21:30.69,0:21:32.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道是不是只有我这样
Dialogue: 1,0:21:32.37,0:21:36.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当我听到梅尔怀孕的事情时 我的心都跟着紧了一下
Dialogue: 1,0:21:36.90,0:21:40.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我在第一次玩这部游戏的时候发推想表达的就是这个意思
Dialogue: 1,0:21:40.92,0:21:44.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,即我感觉游戏的开场太压抑了
Dialogue: 1,0:21:44.85,0:21:50.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的是字面意思 我感觉整个游戏都充满了压抑与恐惧
Dialogue: 1,0:21:50.37,0:21:55.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,你潜意识里就感觉要发生一些糟糕的事情了
Dialogue: 1,0:21:55.17,0:21:59.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道是不是因为游戏之前被剧透了 所以大家都有所预见
Dialogue: 1,0:21:59.61,0:22:05.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是说游戏绝佳的台词与场景设计渲染了这种气氛
Dialogue: 1,0:22:05.76,0:22:09.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,让你自然而然有一种不祥的预感
Dialogue: 1,0:22:09.36,0:22:10.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不确定是哪种
Dialogue: 1,0:22:10.80,0:22:17.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,欢迎在评论区谈谈你的看法 或者在推特艾特我@LukeStephensTV
Dialogue: 1,0:22:17.07,0:22:23.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之我还是忍不住觉得一切可能发生的可怕事情都要发生了
Dialogue: 1,0:22:23.10,0:22:26.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以当我听到那个叫梅尔的女子怀孕了的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:22:26.97,0:22:31.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就预感到她要遭难了
Dialogue: 1,0:22:31.24,0:22:37.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且在我们还没介绍到的艾莉这边阵营中的某个人
Dialogue: 1,0:22:37.08,0:22:41.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,也会怀孕 从而作为两边角色的对比
Dialogue: 1,0:22:41.12,0:22:45.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,建立戏剧冲突 让一个角色面临一个选择
Dialogue: 1,0:22:45.81,0:22:47.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,让另一个角色面临另一个选择
Dialogue: 1,0:22:47.86,0:22:51.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,看看他们在各自的时刻如何反应
Dialogue: 1,0:22:51.15,0:22:55.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然了 如果玩家此时还没通关游戏的话肯定对我说的话摸不着头脑
Dialogue: 1,0:22:55.95,0:22:59.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我就继续讲 稍后再回过头来看这件事
Dialogue: 1,0:22:59.22,0:23:00.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,绝对说得通
Dialogue: 1,0:23:00.70,0:23:04.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和欧文到达了目的地 俯瞰整个杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,0:23:04.65,0:23:06.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个小镇真的很大
Dialogue: 1,0:23:06.45,0:23:12.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,从埃比的反应来看 她应该没想到会这么大
Dialogue: 1,0:23:12.30,0:23:16.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,目前还不知道他们在找什么 但肯定是个男子
Dialogue: 1,0:23:16.17,0:23:22.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,用脚后跟去想都应该马上知道他俩找的肯定是乔尔了
Dialogue: 1,0:23:22.61,0:23:25.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然这个时刻我们还并不知道
Dialogue: 1,0:23:25.18,0:23:31.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,接着欧文说他觉得他们不应该继续找下去了
Dialogue: 1,0:23:31.08,0:23:36.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们无论如何也没法摸进这座小镇
Dialogue: 1,0:23:36.78,0:23:39.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们团队人不多 完全做不到
Dialogue: 1,0:23:39.15,0:23:41.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以欧文建议原路返回
Dialogue: 1,0:23:41.52,0:23:45.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其当下梅尔还怀孕了 他们需要回去照顾她
Dialogue: 1,0:23:45.76,0:23:48.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,请记住这个场景
Dialogue: 1,0:23:48.66,0:23:56.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个男的 欧文 想要回去照顾因他而怀孕的女子
Dialogue: 1,0:23:56.34,0:23:59.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可能很奇怪为什么记住这种随机事件
Dialogue: 1,0:23:59.64,0:24:03.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在游戏剧情后面我们还要遇到类似的场面
Dialogue: 1,0:24:03.06,0:24:08.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,当中艾莉会做出和埃比此刻做出的、同样愚蠢的决定
Dialogue: 1,0:24:08.99,0:24:12.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗会在剧情中加入大量类似的操作
Dialogue: 1,0:24:12.68,0:24:17.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,先让埃比做某件事 然后换个时间地点场景
Dialogue: 1,0:24:17.18,0:24:20.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,让艾莉做一遍同样的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:24:20.20,0:24:24.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,但你会不由自主地、双标地认为艾莉的行为更加正当
Dialogue: 1,0:24:24.84,0:24:28.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,认为埃比只是一个反派角色
Dialogue: 1,0:24:28.23,0:24:30.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个游戏就是靠不同视角来叙事的
Dialogue: 1,0:24:30.30,0:24:36.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种频繁的视角切换是游戏叙事机制中的重要组成部分
Dialogue: 1,0:24:36.00,0:24:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在我自己肯定不想回头
Dialogue: 1,0:24:38.37,0:24:44.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们到这里可能花了几天、几周甚至几个月
Dialogue: 1,0:24:44.06,0:24:48.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,眼看杰克逊小镇就在眼前了却说要回去
Dialogue: 1,0:24:48.66,0:24:50.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,听着就不是啥好主意
Dialogue: 1,0:24:50.40,0:24:53.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,欧文说他们应该回他们目前所待的别墅屋里
Dialogue: 1,0:24:53.64,0:24:56.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,但埃比并不喜欢他的建议
Dialogue: 1,0:24:56.70,0:25:02.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,她很生气 独自一人向杰克逊小镇前进
Dialogue: 1,0:25:02.34,0:25:06.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,想去欧文发现的地方找找看有没有巡逻队
Dialogue: 1,0:25:06.65,0:25:09.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,从他们口中就能问出目标在哪
Dialogue: 1,0:25:09.75,0:25:14.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样她就能在回去之前独自完成该做的任务了
Dialogue: 1,0:25:14.41,0:25:17.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,在控制埃比的时候 一场暴风雪正慢慢形成
Dialogue: 1,0:25:17.73,0:25:22.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,你杀了几个感染者 最后发现了一组巡逻队留下的马蹄印
Dialogue: 1,0:25:22.32,0:25:29.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些巡逻队是由诸如艾莉、蒂娜、杰西、乔尔和汤米等等一些人组成的
Dialogue: 1,0:25:29.43,0:25:36.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是游戏早期为游戏叙述做铺垫而设定的大量巧合中的第一个
Dialogue: 1,0:25:36.18,0:25:39.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比恰好困于暴风雪
Dialogue: 1,0:25:39.53,0:25:42.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,而同时乔尔和其他人恰好在外巡逻
Dialogue: 1,0:25:42.99,0:25:44.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,这类的巧合还会有很多
Dialogue: 1,0:25:44.55,0:25:47.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔和汤米是同一年龄段的
Dialogue: 1,0:25:47.22,0:25:52.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且至少是和他们一起巡逻的年轻人的长辈
Dialogue: 1,0:25:52.02,0:25:57.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 乔尔仍然去巡逻这件事就有点牵强
Dialogue: 1,0:25:57.48,0:25:59.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,让他去巡逻本身就很蠢
Dialogue: 1,0:25:59.40,0:26:02.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其他还在小镇中扮演领导角色
Dialogue: 1,0:26:02.73,0:26:06.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点从他家超级大的房子就能看出
Dialogue: 1,0:26:06.96,0:26:11.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,更不用提他的弟弟汤米也要和他一起巡逻这件事
Dialogue: 1,0:26:11.61,0:26:14.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,而汤米也算是杰克逊小镇的领导者
Dialogue: 1,0:26:14.85,0:26:17.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米和他的妻子共同运营着小镇
Dialogue: 1,0:26:17.85,0:26:23.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以在我看来 乔尔和汤米一起外出巡逻这样的安排有点牵强
Dialogue: 1,0:26:23.22,0:26:28.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我也能理解 或许乔尔和汤米就是想继续闯荡 干些脏活累活
Dialogue: 1,0:26:28.92,0:26:33.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不想让人觉得自己老了 他们想继续为小镇做点贡献
Dialogue: 1,0:26:33.27,0:26:35.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他们想出去巡逻 亲力亲为
Dialogue: 1,0:26:35.25,0:26:38.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样想来倒还算合理
Dialogue: 1,0:26:38.52,0:26:42.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是不禁觉得乔尔和汤米的巡逻路线
Dialogue: 1,0:26:42.16,0:26:46.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,和艾莉、蒂娜与杰西的路线完全相同
Dialogue: 1,0:26:46.65,0:26:48.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,纯粹是制作者有意设定的
Dialogue: 1,0:26:48.49,0:26:57.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样可以确保埃比在森林中迷路时能够遇到乔尔和汤米
Dialogue: 1,0:26:57.60,0:27:01.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是我不喜欢叙事上强凑巧合的原因
Dialogue: 1,0:27:01.32,0:27:09.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,这一般只是为了给编剧提供能让角色进入某种平常不合理的情况的一种方式
Dialogue: 1,0:27:09.27,0:27:11.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,这并不都是坏事
Dialogue: 1,0:27:11.58,0:27:16.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上我觉得有些情况下 巧合可以引出一些很有趣的场景
Dialogue: 1,0:27:16.80,0:27:19.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,就比如《绝命毒师》里的那段场景
Dialogue: 1,0:27:19.29,0:27:23.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,简的父亲在酒吧遇到沃尔特
Dialogue: 1,0:27:23.25,0:27:27.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们简单聊了聊为父之道、聊了聊孩子
Dialogue: 1,0:27:27.90,0:27:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他们完全不会想到他们聊的两个角色
Dialogue: 1,0:27:33.87,0:27:39.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,会共同卷入一段过山车式的剧情当中
Dialogue: 1,0:27:39.40,0:27:44.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,看过这个剧的朋友可能已经知道之后发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,0:27:44.01,0:27:48.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以应该能明白我说的过山车式剧情是什么意思
Dialogue: 1,0:27:48.12,0:27:50.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,但……我不想给大家剧透……所以……
Dialogue: 1,0:27:50.76,0:27:53.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想说的是 快去看《绝命毒师》 老好看了
Dialogue: 1,0:27:53.01,0:27:57.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一方的观点认为叙事上的巧合是可以接受的
Dialogue: 1,0:27:57.24,0:28:02.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟生活中到处都充满了巧合
Dialogue: 1,0:28:02.46,0:28:08.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当巧合被用来强行让角色做他们本来不会做的事情以完成某种情节时候
Dialogue: 1,0:28:08.05,0:28:11.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,问题就出来了
Dialogue: 1,0:28:11.34,0:28:15.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,同样的我还很讨厌故事中强塞的“灵媒”或者“预言”
Dialogue: 1,0:28:15.56,0:28:17.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样纯粹就是犯懒
Dialogue: 1,0:28:17.67,0:28:20.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,作者预先知道自己想让角色去哪做什么
Dialogue: 1,0:28:20.94,0:28:25.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是就胡编个预言提前解释一下要发生什么
Dialogue: 1,0:28:25.53,0:28:29.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,再让他们的角色身上的预言应验
Dialogue: 1,0:28:29.13,0:28:30.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果剧情有点乱
Dialogue: 1,0:28:30.24,0:28:36.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者叙事上、角色上、动机上不太合理
Dialogue: 1,0:28:36.06,0:28:40.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就直接说那个角色在依照预言行事
Dialogue: 1,0:28:40.41,0:28:41.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以就得那样做
Dialogue: 1,0:28:41.61,0:28:44.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,预言说啥就是啥
Dialogue: 1,0:28:44.73,0:28:46.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,老懒狗了
Dialogue: 1,0:28:46.20,0:28:55.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然我觉得TLOU2中的许多巧合无厘头到了犯罪的地步
Dialogue: 1,0:28:55.53,0:29:00.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为其他的事件还算说得通
Dialogue: 1,0:29:00.33,0:29:04.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,但到头来发现这些事件又剪不断 理还乱
Dialogue: 1,0:29:04.95,0:29:09.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此看起来如果顽皮狗想让乔尔遇到埃比
Dialogue: 1,0:29:09.21,0:29:13.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,那这就是最快最干净的实现这个目标的方法
Dialogue: 1,0:29:13.17,0:29:17.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,我在之前的一期YouTube上的NitGrit节目中
Dialogue: 1,0:29:17.13,0:29:21.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,就讨论过了TLOU2里的叙事巧合
Dialogue: 1,0:29:21.60,0:29:27.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些巧合都被塞进了TLOU2的前两小时内容中 让人没法不注意到
Dialogue: 1,0:29:27.75,0:29:32.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,我抛砖引玉想出了另一种开篇剧情
Dialogue: 1,0:29:32.13,0:29:35.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比 欧文和其它某些团队成员
Dialogue: 1,0:29:35.46,0:29:39.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,潜入小镇 努力干活 人人爱戴
Dialogue: 1,0:29:39.88,0:29:44.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,并最终获得了乔尔、汤米和艾莉的信任
Dialogue: 1,0:29:44.92,0:29:49.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终反水 杀死乔尔 并趁夜色逃跑
Dialogue: 1,0:29:49.53,0:29:53.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后游戏剩余部分和原来一样进行
Dialogue: 1,0:29:53.19,0:29:58.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样也可以会很有意思 比如让埃比和艾莉建立一段很牢固的友谊
Dialogue: 1,0:29:58.23,0:30:02.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者至少对彼此有某种同情的感觉
Dialogue: 1,0:30:02.61,0:30:05.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而让之后的背叛显得更加深刻
Dialogue: 1,0:30:05.07,0:30:08.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且即使现在 汤米和乔尔也很欢迎这群人
Dialogue: 1,0:30:08.76,0:30:12.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,二人甚至还邀请他们回杰克逊小镇补给一下再继续上路
Dialogue: 1,0:30:12.88,0:30:16.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后才发生了“那样”的事
Dialogue: 1,0:30:16.98,0:30:19.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我们能看出汤米和乔尔是很开放的
Dialogue: 1,0:30:19.35,0:30:22.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们本打算把这伙人带来小镇 或者只带一两位进来
Dialogue: 1,0:30:22.17,0:30:23.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许他们进入小镇后
Dialogue: 1,0:30:23.70,0:30:29.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,可以装作是想要从零开始新生活却不知所措、需要帮助的幸存者
Dialogue: 1,0:30:29.94,0:30:33.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许他们可以开始在杰克逊小镇干几周的活
Dialogue: 1,0:30:33.42,0:30:38.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者只干几天就反水杀害乔尔然后逃跑
Dialogue: 1,0:30:38.85,0:30:43.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少这样安排 剧情上就不需要强凑那么多的巧合了
Dialogue: 1,0:30:43.02,0:30:47.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我也了解这样或许不利于叙事节奏
Dialogue: 1,0:30:47.35,0:30:52.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其在游戏发售之前还发生了剧情泄露事件
Dialogue: 1,0:30:52.08,0:30:54.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得目前或许的确是最好的选择
Dialogue: 1,0:30:54.27,0:30:56.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为一旦游戏被剧透了
Dialogue: 1,0:30:56.10,0:30:58.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们都早已知道埃比会杀死乔尔
Dialogue: 1,0:30:58.91,0:31:08.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,那一开始艾莉和埃比在开篇的友谊或者至少相互容忍的情节就会被完全否定
Dialogue: 1,0:31:08.67,0:31:11.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,我在推特和邮件中听到过很多人说
Dialogue: 1,0:31:11.79,0:31:15.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗的确考虑过类似的内容作为开篇
Dialogue: 1,0:31:15.12,0:31:18.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,这还是挺有意思的 因为这纯粹是我凭空脑补的
Dialogue: 1,0:31:18.60,0:31:20.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我甚至没太认真去想
Dialogue: 1,0:31:20.34,0:31:24.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,但显然这是一个经过认真考虑过的开篇内容
Dialogue: 1,0:31:24.12,0:31:28.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过没有正式出现在TLOU2游戏中
Dialogue: 1,0:31:28.02,0:31:35.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们当前的叙事决策应该是因为其他版本会有很多叙事节奏上的问题
Dialogue: 1,0:31:35.25,0:31:42.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说 你很可能需要在游戏的前五六个小时在杰克逊做一些琐碎的杂事
Dialogue: 1,0:31:42.34,0:31:46.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,在被背叛之前了解了埃比和她的小队成员
Dialogue: 1,0:31:46.35,0:31:50.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,这将完全改变游戏其余部分的结构
Dialogue: 1,0:31:50.25,0:31:53.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以顽皮狗决定简单粗暴
Dialogue: 1,0:31:53.49,0:31:59.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,让埃比在游戏开始的前两小时内就遇到乔尔 直接开始复仇剧情
Dialogue: 1,0:31:59.61,0:32:00.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得说得过去
Dialogue: 1,0:32:00.75,0:32:06.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是感觉他们为此强凑了这些巧合 还是显得有些草率
Dialogue: 1,0:32:06.42,0:32:10.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,在埃比发现雪地上巡逻队的脚印后
Dialogue: 1,0:32:10.26,0:32:13.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,镜头切回了和蒂娜正在巡逻的艾莉
Dialogue: 1,0:32:13.65,0:32:19.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,你骑着马 踩着结冰的河面 穿过一片风景迷人的区域
Dialogue: 1,0:32:19.26,0:32:20.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的太美了
Dialogue: 1,0:32:20.82,0:32:26.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 我不知道顽皮狗是怎么做的这么美丽的风景
Dialogue: 1,0:32:26.31,0:32:29.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,但真的比不少其他的工作室高到不知道哪里去了
Dialogue: 1,0:32:29.91,0:32:33.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,你一边巡逻 一边对角色有了更深入的了解
Dialogue: 1,0:32:33.75,0:32:35.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,俩人打情骂俏
Dialogue: 1,0:32:35.36,0:32:38.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,很明显 蒂娜喜欢艾莉 艾莉也喜欢蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,0:32:38.82,0:32:41.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,而紧张的气氛此时开始酝酿起来
Dialogue: 1,0:32:41.06,0:32:45.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,事情进展的太顺利 这不太对劲
Dialogue: 1,0:32:45.45,0:32:51.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们都知道TLOU的世界是极其残酷的
Dialogue: 1,0:32:51.19,0:32:56.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏里角色开开心心无忧无虑甚至在打情骂俏
Dialogue: 1,0:32:56.58,0:33:01.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,事实上玩家心里都知道要有不好的事情发生了
Dialogue: 1,0:33:01.14,0:33:05.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,而你继续推进 到了一个前哨站 探索一些废弃的房子
Dialogue: 1,0:33:05.91,0:33:06.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,在某个时刻
Dialogue: 1,0:33:06.96,0:33:13.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉提到她当晚要邀请乔尔一起看电影
Dialogue: 1,0:33:13.02,0:33:17.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,这一信息在故事结尾时极为重要
Dialogue: 1,0:33:17.76,0:33:19.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以请各位务必牢记
Dialogue: 1,0:33:19.56,0:33:26.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉打算当天晚上和乔尔一起看电影
Dialogue: 1,0:33:26.07,0:33:27.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来没什么奇怪的
Dialogue: 1,0:33:27.60,0:33:33.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家也都知道艾莉和乔尔有着很深的情感上的羁绊
Dialogue: 1,0:33:33.09,0:33:37.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,她甚至就住乔尔家房子后面的附属房里
Dialogue: 1,0:33:37.20,0:33:40.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,俩人晚上一起打发时间看个电影 听上去很合理
Dialogue: 1,0:33:40.74,0:33:42.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,俩人晚上一起打发时间看个电影 听上去很合理
Dialogue: 1,0:33:42.60,0:33:46.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是到了游戏结尾 我们就会发现这部分的信息量有多么大
Dialogue: 1,0:33:46.29,0:33:51.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且艾莉提到的这段内容是在你探索一废弃房子时作为可选对话发生的
Dialogue: 1,0:33:51.32,0:33:53.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且艾莉提到的这段内容是在你探索一废弃房子时作为可选对话发生的
Dialogue: 1,0:33:54.16,0:33:56.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,这将会非常非常重要
Dialogue: 1,0:33:56.10,0:33:59.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和蒂娜来到了一个有感染者出没的超市
Dialogue: 1,0:33:59.07,0:34:03.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人清空了感染者 并借此学习了潜行或者战斗的技巧
Dialogue: 1,0:34:03.84,0:34:07.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是这款游戏做得真的很棒的一部分
Dialogue: 1,0:34:07.44,0:34:10.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为游戏自带的潜行与制作元素
Dialogue: 1,0:34:10.76,0:34:13.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,将会是游戏本身的调味品
Dialogue: 1,0:34:13.71,0:34:16.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其在高难度下
Dialogue: 1,0:34:16.05,0:34:20.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,你更需要很快适应这部分的游戏机制
Dialogue: 1,0:34:20.55,0:34:23.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后游戏还快速介绍了一下循声者
Dialogue: 1,0:34:23.61,0:34:27.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,这类感染者和一代里的几乎完全一样
Dialogue: 1,0:34:27.39,0:34:31.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得不太需要过多解释循声者的机制
Dialogue: 1,0:34:31.86,0:34:36.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为如果你玩过一代的话 就肯定已经知道了
Dialogue: 1,0:34:36.00,0:34:39.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,其实我们还要玩很久才会遇到全新的感染者
Dialogue: 1,0:34:39.57,0:34:41.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,而在第一代游戏当中
Dialogue: 1,0:34:41.25,0:34:42.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,有一件事让我很困扰
Dialogue: 1,0:34:42.20,0:34:45.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,循声者显然是利用自己的咔咔声产生的回声定位来识别环境的
Dialogue: 1,0:34:45.91,0:34:51.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,循声者显然是利用自己的咔咔声产生的回声定位来识别环境的
Dialogue: 1,0:34:51.27,0:34:55.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而 它们从来不会听到出角色们互相交流的声音
Dialogue: 1,0:34:55.40,0:34:59.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,也听不见你上子弹、翻背包或者背回去的声音
Dialogue: 1,0:34:59.88,0:35:06.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,但到了这代游戏 就只在低难度下才成立了
Dialogue: 1,0:35:06.36,0:35:11.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,我专门测试过 在我的二周目生还者难度下
Dialogue: 1,0:35:11.43,0:35:13.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,循声者的确能听到这两点
Dialogue: 1,0:35:13.98,0:35:18.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你打开背包切换武器 那它们真的会听到并向你走来
Dialogue: 1,0:35:18.96,0:35:22.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这方面游戏的沉浸感有所提升
Dialogue: 1,0:35:22.89,0:35:28.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 我从来没有玩过这样一款需要如此蹑手蹑脚行动的游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:35:28.53,0:35:31.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,就连打开背包这种事都会害怕
Dialogue: 1,0:35:31.74,0:35:37.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我知道这样会制造一点点噪音 会吸引循声者过来
Dialogue: 1,0:35:37.56,0:35:40.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致我要么死要么重新读档
Dialogue: 1,0:35:40.36,0:35:43.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,我向大家保证 循声者的声音可老吓人了
Dialogue: 1,0:35:43.44,0:35:46.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以游戏开始才会有难度设定
Dialogue: 1,0:35:46.08,0:35:49.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你想有个完美的沉浸式体验
Dialogue: 1,0:35:49.47,0:35:52.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我强烈建议玩个最高难度试试
Dialogue: 1,0:35:52.92,0:35:54.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的感觉一切都不一样了
Dialogue: 1,0:35:54.90,0:35:57.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段超市场景中另外一个要注意的点是
Dialogue: 1,0:35:57.68,0:36:01.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉现在暴露在孢子中时会戴着面具
Dialogue: 1,0:36:01.32,0:36:02.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你玩过一代游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:36:02.43,0:36:07.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能会比较奇怪 因为众所周知艾莉是对真菌免疫的
Dialogue: 1,0:36:07.41,0:36:10.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,那她为何还要戴着防毒面具呢？
Dialogue: 1,0:36:10.41,0:36:12.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,在游戏发售前的预告片里
Dialogue: 1,0:36:12.66,0:36:16.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人认为这可能意味着艾莉不再有免疫能力了
Dialogue: 1,0:36:16.11,0:36:20.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能她不像之前那样可以对孢子免疫了
Dialogue: 1,0:36:20.49,0:36:24.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能如果她吸入了孢子 就会生重病
Dialogue: 1,0:36:24.06,0:36:25.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她仍然能挺过去
Dialogue: 1,0:36:25.74,0:36:28.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而真实情况简单得多
Dialogue: 1,0:36:28.02,0:36:33.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔和艾莉都知道艾莉是免疫的 但其他人不能知道这件事
Dialogue: 1,0:36:33.69,0:36:35.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果有人发现艾莉是免疫的这一点
Dialogue: 1,0:36:35.82,0:36:39.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,之前火萤遇到的那些破事就会重蹈覆辙
Dialogue: 1,0:36:39.72,0:36:43.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然现在看来这更像是乔尔的一厢情愿
Dialogue: 1,0:36:43.71,0:36:48.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟艾莉自己是有打算想要自我献身为全人类研发疫苗的
Dialogue: 1,0:36:48.37,0:36:51.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟艾莉自己是有打算想要自我献身为全人类研发疫苗的
Dialogue: 1,0:36:51.09,0:36:53.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这也完全说得通 因为乔尔要保证
Dialogue: 1,0:36:53.84,0:36:58.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,不会有其他人因为艾莉的免疫能力而对她穷追不舍
Dialogue: 1,0:36:58.53,0:37:01.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果有其他人知道 那乔尔就很可能会失去艾莉
Dialogue: 1,0:37:01.29,0:37:04.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,但实际上 艾莉这边知道自己不需要 却还在戴着防毒面具
Dialogue: 1,0:37:04.98,0:37:08.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得还能说明艾莉是在乎乔尔的想法的
Dialogue: 1,0:37:08.79,0:37:11.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且她还没法完全离开乔尔独立生活
Dialogue: 1,0:37:11.64,0:37:16.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这件事在游戏中的此刻还是没有完全解释通
Dialogue: 1,0:37:16.14,0:37:22.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过未来我们会看到乔尔和艾莉在对话中专门解释此事
Dialogue: 1,0:37:22.32,0:37:24.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人解决了一堆感染者和循声者
Dialogue: 1,0:37:24.70,0:37:27.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终来到超市的楼顶
Dialogue: 1,0:37:27.33,0:37:29.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,跳下来回到超市前面
Dialogue: 1,0:37:29.58,0:37:35.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和蒂娜目的就是清空超市里的感染者
Dialogue: 1,0:37:35.16,0:37:36.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,而她们也的确完成了
Dialogue: 1,0:37:36.33,0:37:40.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上我觉得游戏为了让玩家熟悉适应战斗系统
Dialogue: 1,0:37:40.12,0:37:44.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,而要求玩家必须杀死所有感染者是可以接受的
Dialogue: 1,0:37:44.01,0:37:48.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,许多玩家在绝大多数场景下会采取潜行的方式
Dialogue: 1,0:37:48.33,0:37:51.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其在游戏后期 资源非常匮乏的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:37:51.45,0:37:58.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果角色的任务是清空所有感染者以保护杰克逊小镇的安全
Dialogue: 1,0:37:58.23,0:38:01.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就对无双打法就没什么顾虑了
Dialogue: 1,0:38:01.04,0:38:05.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为玩家这种杀光感染者的操作是完全合理的
Dialogue: 1,0:38:05.46,0:38:07.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟如果玩家不清空区域内的感染者就无法离开这里
Dialogue: 1,0:38:07.23,0:38:11.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟如果玩家不清空区域内的感染者就无法离开这里
Dialogue: 1,0:38:11.07,0:38:15.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人离开超市后 暴风雪越来越猛烈
Dialogue: 1,0:38:15.93,0:38:21.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是她们赶忙穿越风雪 来到了蒂娜知道的一家图书馆
Dialogue: 1,0:38:21.66,0:38:24.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里是一个叫尤金的人之前的住所
Dialogue: 1,0:38:24.36,0:38:28.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,我记得他还在之前的前哨站的签到本上有出现过
Dialogue: 1,0:38:28.50,0:38:34.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,很可能在前一年死于中风 就在这个游戏开始前几个月
Dialogue: 1,0:38:34.92,0:38:38.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们了解到他曾和汤米一起在火萤组织服役过
Dialogue: 1,0:38:38.31,0:38:42.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是个电子产品的怪胎 还是个哈草战士
Dialogue: 1,0:38:42.45,0:38:44.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 他喜欢抽大麻
Dialogue: 1,0:38:44.42,0:38:46.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,在介绍了我在所有游戏里见过的最逼真的改装武器的工作台后
Dialogue: 1,0:38:46.32,0:38:52.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,在介绍了我在所有游戏里见过的最逼真的改装武器的工作台后
Dialogue: 1,0:38:52.63,0:38:54.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,在介绍了我在所有游戏里见过的最逼真的改装武器的工作台后
Dialogue: 1,0:38:54.50,0:38:58.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家来到地下室 发现了尤金真正充满秘密的小天地
Dialogue: 1,0:38:58.68,0:39:00.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,我第一眼见到这些的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:39:00.15,0:39:07.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就想问他在卖这些东西吗？他会拿这些东西进行交易吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:39:07.17,0:39:09.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道 或许我漏了某个上面解释了尤金具体在做什么的纸条
Dialogue: 1,0:39:09.21,0:39:12.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道 或许我漏了某个上面解释了尤金具体在做什么的纸条
Dialogue: 1,0:39:12.78,0:39:17.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,不清楚 如果还有什么我没发现的东西的话请大家告诉我一下
Dialogue: 1,0:39:17.40,0:39:22.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果真用于贸易 那这似乎是杰克逊的一个巨大的潜在机会
Dialogue: 1,0:39:22.56,0:39:27.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,利用完整的大麻供应链提供给进出的流浪者
Dialogue: 1,0:39:27.36,0:39:32.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果杰克逊这样在末世中的繁荣小镇
Dialogue: 1,0:39:32.00,0:39:36.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个经济是基于大麻贸易 那将是相当有趣的
Dialogue: 1,0:39:36.42,0:39:39.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这样的末世下 一种植物让大家团结在一起 是很搞笑也是很酷的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:39:39.76,0:39:44.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这样的末世下 一种植物让大家团结在一起 是很搞笑也是很酷的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:39:44.58,0:39:46.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,我的意思是……嗯……我家在科罗拉多
Dialogue: 1,0:39:46.35,0:39:50.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许这就是为什么我会这样想吧
Dialogue: 1,0:39:50.13,0:39:53.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然我自己不抽那种东西的……不抽的
Dialogue: 1,0:39:53.80,0:39:58.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当然了 科罗拉多的很多人都会谈论大麻 自己就跟着耳濡目染了
Dialogue: 1,0:39:58.77,0:40:00.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,说到哪了？哦对！
Dialogue: 1,0:40:00.66,0:40:02.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜和艾莉抽了一根
Dialogue: 1,0:40:02.31,0:40:07.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们像高中音乐舞会一般聊了两人前一天晚上的吻
Dialogue: 1,0:40:07.71,0:40:10.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后一言不合就又开始打啵了
Dialogue: 1,0:40:10.80,0:40:16.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终俩人开始搞起来 然后镜头再次切回埃比
Dialogue: 1,0:40:16.62,0:40:18.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,她在躲避大量的感染者
Dialogue: 1,0:40:18.51,0:40:21.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,她弄的动静太大了 感染者们肯定都听到了
Dialogue: 1,0:40:21.75,0:40:26.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,这与之前平静祥和的场景产生了鲜明对比
Dialogue: 1,0:40:26.04,0:40:28.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的节奏变换在游戏中会经常出现
Dialogue: 1,0:40:28.29,0:40:29.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,说实话 我很喜欢
Dialogue: 1,0:40:29.70,0:40:31.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是顽皮狗的特色招数
Dialogue: 1,0:40:31.50,0:40:32.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,先让你兴奋起来
Dialogue: 1,0:40:32.44,0:40:36.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后作为对比 给你看一些平静的内容 降低你的心率
Dialogue: 1,0:40:36.05,0:40:41.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后马上给你当头一棒 转而又让一切归于平静
Dialogue: 1,0:40:41.37,0:40:44.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,最好的例子就是一代游戏的开场部分
Dialogue: 1,0:40:44.52,0:40:46.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,一开始一切是如此祥和轻快
Dialogue: 1,0:40:46.59,0:40:50.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后一下子世界末日就到了 然后你女儿就说没就没了
Dialogue: 1,0:40:50.88,0:40:55.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后画面马上又切到了20年后乔尔从床上恍然惊醒的场景
Dialogue: 1,0:40:55.75,0:41:00.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,再然后就是和泰丝的一段相对平缓的对话
Dialogue: 1,0:41:00.97,0:41:02.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,瞧好吧您嘞
Dialogue: 1,0:41:02.00,0:41:06.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的转折在续作中简直就是家常便饭
Dialogue: 1,0:41:06.18,0:41:08.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且谢天谢地 这种转折的应用并不会对叙事效果带来负面影响
Dialogue: 1,0:41:08.40,0:41:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且谢天谢地 这种转折的应用并不会对叙事效果带来负面影响
Dialogue: 1,0:41:11.52,0:41:12.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,仍然非常有看头
Dialogue: 1,0:41:12.70,0:41:18.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家操控埃比逃离这群感染者 最后来到一处铁丝网后面
Dialogue: 1,0:41:18.28,0:41:21.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,你挤过这里 旁边还有感染者想抓你
Dialogue: 1,0:41:21.81,0:41:28.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,你的帽子被抢走了 感染者们对你上下其手 还有一只冲破了铁丝网
Dialogue: 1,0:41:28.23,0:41:29.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后就是……
Dialogue: 1,0:41:46.44,0:41:48.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,目前他们还没进行自我介绍
Dialogue: 1,0:41:48.00,0:41:51.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,但就目前来讲 埃比很庆幸自己活下来了
Dialogue: 1,0:41:51.54,0:41:52.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,据她所了解
Dialogue: 1,0:41:52.92,0:41:55.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔和汤米都是万千普通人之一
Dialogue: 1,0:41:55.80,0:41:59.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,而刚好他们俩就在正确的时间正确的地点出现在她面前救了她一命
Dialogue: 1,0:41:59.71,0:42:01.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,又是一个巧合
Dialogue: 1,0:42:01.32,0:42:04.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点就很难说得通了
Dialogue: 1,0:42:04.75,0:42:10.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,他俩完全没理由要跑到这样一个建筑的死胡同
Dialogue: 1,0:42:10.44,0:42:13.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,三人一起逃到了雪山山顶的一个缆车站
Dialogue: 1,0:42:13.68,0:42:14.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们骑上马
Dialogue: 1,0:42:14.82,0:42:18.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,一段简短的介绍后埃比知道了他俩是谁
Dialogue: 1,0:42:18.96,0:42:23.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,她提议去她和朋友们驻扎的那栋别墅屋里躲避暴风雪
Dialogue: 1,0:42:23.55,0:42:26.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔和汤米想都没想就同意了
Dialogue: 1,0:42:26.98,0:42:29.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,完全不像是活过缆车站战斗的人能做出的决策
Dialogue: 1,0:42:30.05,0:42:32.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,这又是一个巧合
Dialogue: 1,0:42:32.55,0:42:34.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔和汤米谁也不傻
Dialogue: 1,0:42:34.49,0:42:39.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使在这样艰难的条件下也不应该这么武断
Dialogue: 1,0:42:39.27,0:42:42.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,我明白外面暴风雪肆虐
Dialogue: 1,0:42:42.27,0:42:49.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也明白这会让他们做出相比天气晴好的时候不会做出的选择
Dialogue: 1,0:42:49.35,0:42:53.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,但乔尔和汤米都不傻 他们都知道不应该轻易相信陌生人的话
Dialogue: 1,0:42:53.49,0:42:58.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使这个人看上去多么无辜善良
Dialogue: 1,0:42:58.44,0:43:06.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们肯定应该知道不应该轻易相信一群住在他们巡逻路线上别墅里的陌生人
Dialogue: 1,0:43:06.93,0:43:09.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比说他们已经在那待几天了
Dialogue: 1,0:43:09.20,0:43:14.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们有武器 有食物等物资可以帮助乔尔和汤米
Dialogue: 1,0:43:14.22,0:43:17.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,她能主动提出帮助固然是好的
Dialogue: 1,0:43:17.55,0:43:23.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,但首先应该警惕的是她主动提供帮助的目的何在
Dialogue: 1,0:43:23.22,0:43:30.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,还要注意到这帮人神不知鬼不觉地就在离杰克逊小镇如此近的地方落脚
Dialogue: 1,0:43:30.15,0:43:32.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之乔尔和汤米还是同意一起去了
Dialogue: 1,0:43:32.36,0:43:36.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,抵达别墅屋后 乔尔、汤米和埃比下马 一起进入了房间
Dialogue: 1,0:43:36.93,0:43:40.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比显然表情很纠结 而汤米和乔尔谁也没注意到
Dialogue: 1,0:43:40.81,0:43:44.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,恐惧的氛围再次袭来
Dialogue: 1,0:43:44.20,0:43:47.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,事情很不对劲
Dialogue: 1,0:43:47.16,0:43:52.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家都来到了地下室旁边的房间 乔尔和汤米各自做了自我介绍
Dialogue: 1,0:43:52.01,0:43:56.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,同样 这种操作和他们本人人设太不符了
Dialogue: 1,0:43:56.08,0:43:58.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,竟然会在一堆陌生人面前自报家门
Dialogue: 1,0:43:58.65,0:44:01.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我个人认为这点倒是没那么牵强
Dialogue: 1,0:44:01.29,0:44:06.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为汤米和乔尔没必要认为他们的名字会暴露他们的身份
Dialogue: 1,0:44:06.03,0:44:09.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者认为报了名字就会被追杀
Dialogue: 1,0:44:09.18,0:44:12.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们的确干过不少烂事
Dialogue: 1,0:44:12.18,0:44:17.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但光靠一个名字就全国范围内追着砍
Dialogue: 1,0:44:17.40,0:44:19.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,这才有点离谱
Dialogue: 1,0:44:19.20,0:44:20.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,反正事已至此
Dialogue: 1,0:44:20.39,0:44:24.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想说的是 我觉得乔尔和汤米两人在一群
Dialogue: 1,0:44:24.88,0:44:28.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,看似要帮助他们的人面前自报姓名没那么难以让人接受
Dialogue: 1,0:44:28.71,0:44:32.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然我不得不承认 在整个游戏的序幕中
Dialogue: 1,0:44:32.52,0:44:38.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,如此缓慢而稳定建立起来的恐惧感真的太让人印象深刻了
Dialogue: 1,0:44:38.55,0:44:47.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,在乔尔说出自己名字的一刻 房间里所有人脸色都从友善瞬间变成冷淡与邪恶
Dialogue: 1,0:44:47.91,0:44:50.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得我永远都忘不掉那一刻
Dialogue: 1,0:44:50.41,0:44:54.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔说出名字的时候 房间瞬间安静下来
Dialogue: 1,0:44:54.18,0:44:56.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,连地上掉根针都能听见
Dialogue: 1,0:44:56.36,0:45:01.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们从之前友好的神色一转变成紧盯猎物的鬣狗
Dialogue: 1,0:45:01.53,0:45:07.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且需要注意的是 在乔尔介绍自己之前我们感受到的这种友善
Dialogue: 1,0:45:07.00,0:45:11.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,是非常重要的 而且以后还会出现 我向大家保证
Dialogue: 1,0:45:11.97,0:45:15.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,接着 乔尔主动打破了这份宁静 然后……
Dialogue: 1,0:47:45.63,0:47:48.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,镜头回到艾莉 她正慢慢接近别墅屋
Dialogue: 1,0:47:48.06,0:47:52.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,就在乔尔与汤米一起和埃比来到别墅之前
Dialogue: 1,0:47:52.29,0:48:01.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们看到杰西在尤金的图书馆地下室里找到了事后的艾莉和蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,0:48:01.26,0:48:06.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,他告诉两人乔尔和汤米不见了 暴风雪来了之后就没人见过他俩
Dialogue: 1,0:48:06.48,0:48:10.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉突然惊慌失措 立刻上马去帮忙找他俩
Dialogue: 1,0:48:10.35,0:48:13.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,但要注意的是 艾莉强调
Dialogue: 1,0:48:13.41,0:48:17.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们应该分头行动 搜寻尽可能多的地方
Dialogue: 1,0:48:17.16,0:48:19.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,一些人可能会觉得这也是在凑巧合
Dialogue: 1,0:48:19.72,0:48:22.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者说这样行动有些牵强 他们实际应该不会这样做
Dialogue: 1,0:48:22.37,0:48:23.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,但大家还是要想一想
Dialogue: 1,0:48:23.94,0:48:26.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,站在艾莉的角度 我觉得这没什么牵强的
Dialogue: 1,0:48:26.73,0:48:28.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为据艾莉所知
Dialogue: 1,0:48:28.56,0:48:33.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔和汤米很有可能只是因为暴风雪而不得不躲在某个地方
Dialogue: 1,0:48:33.80,0:48:36.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,并且可能遭遇了意外
Dialogue: 1,0:48:36.27,0:48:42.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,她不可能预料到乔尔会被来自西雅图的一帮人追杀
Dialogue: 1,0:48:42.15,0:48:46.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,但不管怎样 大家都立即开始寻找乔尔和汤米
Dialogue: 1,0:48:46.05,0:48:50.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,在埃比开始攻击乔尔的时候 镜头切到了逐渐靠近别墅屋的艾莉
Dialogue: 1,0:48:50.37,0:48:54.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏在这里迷惑了大家一下 你可以在进入别墅屋后拾取一些弹药补给
Dialogue: 1,0:48:54.54,0:48:56.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,让你以为大战之前必有补给
Dialogue: 1,0:48:56.70,0:48:58.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,我还挺喜欢这样的设定的
Dialogue: 1,0:48:58.08,0:49:00.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏在这里故意骗你
Dialogue: 1,0:49:00.09,0:49:01.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,让你做好战斗的准备
Dialogue: 1,0:49:01.14,0:49:04.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后告诉你这些都没用 当然可能只有我喜欢这样的设定
Dialogue: 1,0:49:04.23,0:49:08.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然这样的设定完全依赖于我们进入地下室后 发生了这样的事情……
Dialogue: 1,0:51:15.15,0:51:19.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比的团队之间就如何处理艾莉进行了一番激烈的争论
Dialogue: 1,0:51:19.44,0:51:22.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,但声音非常小 玩家什么都听不清
Dialogue: 1,0:51:22.14,0:51:24.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我们稍后会从另一个视角看到这部分内容
Dialogue: 1,0:51:24.90,0:51:26.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后其中一人一脚把她踢晕了
Dialogue: 1,0:51:26.73,0:51:30.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,一段时间后 赶来救援的蒂娜和杰西叫醒了她
Dialogue: 1,0:51:30.94,0:51:35.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,此时大家还不清楚汤米是否活了下来 但乔尔肯定没有
Dialogue: 1,0:51:45.39,0:51:51.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,知道吗 我觉得现在挺适合聊聊大家一直视而不见的一件事了
Dialogue: 1,0:51:51.12,0:51:52.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我玩游戏之前就被剧透了
Dialogue: 1,0:51:52.41,0:51:55.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我知道乔尔会在某个时间点死去
Dialogue: 1,0:51:55.56,0:51:56.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且说实话
Dialogue: 1,0:51:56.37,0:52:01.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,我感觉好像很多人都认为乔尔在游戏中的几年前就感觉他要没
Dialogue: 1,0:52:01.83,0:52:03.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这完全说得通
Dialogue: 1,0:52:03.72,0:52:08.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人对“续作”有一个刻板印象 即前作里的某个主要角色会在续作中死去
Dialogue: 1,0:52:08.44,0:52:11.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人对“续作”有一个刻板印象 即前作里的某个主要角色会在续作中死去
Dialogue: 1,0:52:11.91,0:52:15.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,不管是电影、小说、播客还是游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:52:15.52,0:52:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们一次又一次地看到无数桥段在上演这样的套路
Dialogue: 1,0:52:18.59,0:52:22.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这之所以是“套路” 因为这样做其实很有效
Dialogue: 1,0:52:22.17,0:52:27.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,在第一部作品的故事中 你和角色一起成长 爱上了这个角色
Dialogue: 1,0:52:27.00,0:52:30.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后在这样的基础下 续作中直接拆散玩家与一代角色的羁绊
Dialogue: 1,0:52:30.86,0:52:34.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,给所有玩家当头一棒
Dialogue: 1,0:52:34.26,0:52:38.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者在这个游戏里应该叫……当头一高尔夫
Dialogue: 1,0:52:38.46,0:52:40.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能有点猝不及防 管他呢 继续说我的
Dialogue: 1,0:52:40.62,0:52:46.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使在这个游戏推出之前 很多人就已经确定了这一预设
Dialogue: 1,0:52:46.23,0:52:52.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,但顽皮狗似乎也积极地用发售前的预告片试图劝阻粉丝们放弃这一幻想
Dialogue: 1,0:52:52.98,0:52:59.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,其实这点惹得不少玩家在通关后有所不满
Dialogue: 1,0:52:59.61,0:53:02.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,预告片里有很多内容
Dialogue: 1,0:53:02.72,0:53:06.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,在实际游戏里并没有出现
Dialogue: 1,0:53:06.45,0:53:08.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,最明显的例子就是这个
Dialogue: 1,0:53:08.86,0:53:12.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉正在和一群华盛顿解放战线作战
Dialogue: 1,0:53:12.00,0:53:15.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,突然一只手捂住了她的嘴
Dialogue: 1,0:53:15.00,0:53:18.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后她转身 发现是乔尔
Dialogue: 1,0:53:18.06,0:53:21.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,告诉她自己不会让她一个人做这些事
Dialogue: 1,0:53:21.39,0:53:24.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,我对这个内容肯定不会像很多人在推特上那样无脑的说
Dialogue: 1,0:53:24.59,0:53:27.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,“游戏在搞虚假宣传”“RNM退钱！”
Dialogue: 1,0:53:27.42,0:53:28.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这是不公平的
Dialogue: 1,0:53:28.86,0:53:32.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其你花了60美元已经玩了前面那么多游戏内容了
Dialogue: 1,0:53:32.99,0:53:36.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,我才懒得跟你们解释这些 太蠢了
Dialogue: 1,0:53:36.66,0:53:39.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我想说的是 这段内容让我很困扰
Dialogue: 1,0:53:39.42,0:53:42.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少对我来说 在我第一次通关游戏的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:53:42.09,0:53:44.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,我已经看过很多次预告片了
Dialogue: 1,0:53:44.85,0:53:50.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,我知道乔尔在游戏后面仍然会出场 因为艾莉遇到他了
Dialogue: 1,0:53:50.43,0:53:53.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这并没有在实际游戏中出现过
Dialogue: 1,0:53:53.70,0:53:57.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我一直在想是不是之后会有一段比如梦里的场景
Dialogue: 1,0:53:57.69,0:54:00.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,她重新进行了一遍那里的战斗
Dialogue: 1,0:54:00.33,0:54:05.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这次那只手是乔尔的 然后他说了那样的话
Dialogue: 1,0:54:05.13,0:54:08.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然不用我说你们也知道这并没有发生
Dialogue: 1,0:54:08.25,0:54:14.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,这其实只是一种把粉丝的注意力从真正要发生的事情上转移开的方法
Dialogue: 1,0:54:14.16,0:54:16.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且顽皮狗干这种事不是第一次了
Dialogue: 1,0:54:16.68,0:54:18.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是我并不怪他们的部分原因
Dialogue: 1,0:54:18.99,0:54:20.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为通常他们的出发点是好的
Dialogue: 1,0:54:20.64,0:54:23.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,最好的例子就是初代TLOU
Dialogue: 1,0:54:23.58,0:54:27.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们说你游戏全程只会操控乔尔
Dialogue: 1,0:54:27.45,0:54:29.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然这不是事实
Dialogue: 1,0:54:29.91,0:54:32.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也使得当你在玩艾莉的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:54:32.97,0:54:36.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,这话怎么听着这么别扭
Dialogue: 1,0:54:36.03,0:54:38.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也使得当你在操控艾莉这个角色的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:54:38.85,0:54:45.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个过程就显得更加真实 因为你根本没有想到会有这样的机会
Dialogue: 1,0:54:45.39,0:54:47.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一个例子就是本作了
Dialogue: 1,0:54:47.49,0:54:53.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们说在TLOU2里 全程你只会操控艾莉一个角色
Dialogue: 1,0:54:53.28,0:54:55.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这当然也是假的
Dialogue: 1,0:54:55.47,0:55:00.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些本想为玩家提供更好游戏体验的善意谎言有一个问题
Dialogue: 1,0:55:00.85,0:55:04.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是它们只能在人们不了解的情况下起作用
Dialogue: 1,0:55:04.48,0:55:06.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,在初代游戏中 据我所了解到的情况
Dialogue: 1,0:55:06.99,0:55:11.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,大多数人都认为在整个游戏过程中你只能操控乔尔
Dialogue: 1,0:55:11.37,0:55:15.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,那当你开始操控艾莉的时候 这样善意的谎言就有用了
Dialogue: 1,0:55:15.48,0:55:19.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏突然变得更有意思了 因为玩家根本没有意料到此事
Dialogue: 1,0:55:19.98,0:55:25.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,但TLOU2的泄密事件让玩家们老早就知道要发生什么了
Dialogue: 1,0:55:25.80,0:55:27.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种善意谎言的作用就荡然无存了
Dialogue: 1,0:55:27.75,0:55:34.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,我其实花过很多时间思考如果我没被剧透 没有预见这些 游戏会是什么样的
Dialogue: 1,0:55:34.83,0:55:37.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得游戏体验会有很大不同
Dialogue: 1,0:55:37.23,0:55:40.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我也不知道这会怎样改变我的视角
Dialogue: 1,0:55:40.38,0:55:43.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 如果您是这样的幸运玩家
Dialogue: 1,0:55:43.96,0:55:48.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩游戏的时候没看过之前任何剧透的话
Dialogue: 1,0:55:48.00,0:55:52.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,我希望您能在评论区或者推特留下您的想法
Dialogue: 1,0:55:52.04,0:55:56.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真的很期待能看看您对这一切有着怎样的视角
Dialogue: 1,0:55:56.73,0:56:01.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对于乔尔的死这件事 我觉得没什么问题
Dialogue: 1,0:56:01.44,0:56:04.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,在第一部作品中 乔尔的行为相当鲁莽
Dialogue: 1,0:56:04.83,0:56:09.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,他在第一部里坑了不少人 也杀了不少人
Dialogue: 1,0:56:09.84,0:56:14.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,这话我之前说过 我现在也要说：我不认为乔尔是英雄
Dialogue: 1,0:56:14.82,0:56:19.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,真要说的话 抛开一切来看 他应该是一个反英雄
Dialogue: 1,0:56:19.38,0:56:25.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,你完全可以说人生与道德在实际生活中会复杂得多
Dialogue: 1,0:56:25.08,0:56:35.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我仍然认为乔尔不能算是我们大家应该敬仰 应该向他学习的道德标杆
Dialogue: 1,0:56:35.70,0:56:42.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得相反 他是一个有心理创伤的、悲伤的、有道德的角色
Dialogue: 1,0:56:42.55,0:56:48.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,他会为了生存 为了保护她所关心的人做他该做的事
Dialogue: 1,0:56:48.06,0:56:51.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,这一点我认为从某种程度上说是值得钦佩的
Dialogue: 1,0:56:51.51,0:56:56.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,但不能因为这就能说你是“英雄”了
Dialogue: 1,0:56:56.30,0:56:59.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,作为对比 可以想想埃洛伊这样的角色
Dialogue: 1,0:56:59.37,0:57:04.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,她无论遇到什么事情都会做出相对道德的决策
Dialogue: 1,0:57:04.50,0:57:08.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,再往远了说 在游玩时我们一直在操控乔尔
Dialogue: 1,0:57:08.96,0:57:13.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们了解他 站在他的视角经历了很多事情
Dialogue: 1,0:57:13.11,0:57:15.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得应该换换角度看看新内容了
Dialogue: 1,0:57:15.00,0:57:20.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果我们之前游玩乔尔和艾莉的比重各占一半
Dialogue: 1,0:57:20.10,0:57:22.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我想这样带来的震撼就会轻得多
Dialogue: 1,0:57:22.47,0:57:27.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔的死对我来讲感觉丝毫没什么意外的
Dialogue: 1,0:57:27.00,0:57:29.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其当你走进别墅屋地下室那道门之后
Dialogue: 1,0:57:29.94,0:57:36.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 看到乔尔被高尔夫球杆打爆脑袋内心感受还是很糟糕的
Dialogue: 1,0:57:36.00,0:57:39.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段剧情让你心里发堵 但它就是这样设计的
Dialogue: 1,0:57:39.12,0:57:44.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗需要让玩家有和艾莉同样极度悲伤的感受
Dialogue: 1,0:57:44.04,0:57:47.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们需要玩家能和艾莉有同样的内心情感
Dialogue: 1,0:57:47.31,0:57:50.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其是对埃比的恨
Dialogue: 1,0:57:50.04,0:57:54.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是他们想让玩家在游戏前期建立起的主要感情基调
Dialogue: 1,0:57:54.81,0:58:00.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,而你作为玩家 需要对埃比从头发丝恨到脚后跟
Dialogue: 1,0:58:00.03,0:58:03.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像艾莉也对埃比恨之入骨一样
Dialogue: 1,0:58:03.99,0:58:08.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样一来等之后游戏完全调转视角
Dialogue: 1,0:58:08.88,0:58:10.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,就有很强的效果了
Dialogue: 1,0:58:10.92,0:58:12.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你对埃比毫无感觉
Dialogue: 1,0:58:12.68,0:58:17.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你游玩整个游戏尝试复仇的时候
Dialogue: 1,0:58:17.01,0:58:19.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,就会感觉毫无动力
Dialogue: 1,0:58:19.26,0:58:26.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个游戏剧情的前提和故事都是空中楼阁 游戏会变得无聊
Dialogue: 1,0:58:26.01,0:58:32.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果你像艾莉想把埃比千刀万剐一样恨埃比
Dialogue: 1,0:58:32.37,0:58:35.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,你在游玩游戏前半部分的时候就会充满动力
Dialogue: 1,0:58:35.85,0:58:39.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后顽皮狗再为最后一幕做准备
Dialogue: 1,0:58:39.87,0:58:42.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,至此 我们来到了游戏序章部分的结尾
Dialogue: 1,0:58:42.60,0:58:47.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 你已经看了一个小时的视频了 我们才要讲完序章部分
Dialogue: 1,0:58:47.64,0:58:49.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和汤米讨论他们接下来的决策
Dialogue: 1,0:58:49.74,0:58:53.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米跟玛丽娅提了下 而她不让汤米采取任何行动
Dialogue: 1,0:58:53.43,0:58:56.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,也不给他分配任何帮手
Dialogue: 1,0:58:56.55,0:58:58.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以汤米必须把他们留在杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,0:58:58.41,0:59:00.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,玛丽娅认为他们应该放下这些
Dialogue: 1,0:59:00.18,0:59:03.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,发生的事情很可怕 但生活还要继续
Dialogue: 1,0:59:03.99,0:59:07.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,像往常一样 玛丽娅一直是那个看似最理智的人
Dialogue: 1,0:59:07.08,0:59:10.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,而汤米和艾莉的不满也是可以理解的
Dialogue: 1,0:59:10.23,0:59:13.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米的哥哥惨死
Dialogue: 1,0:59:13.26,0:59:17.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉也痛失她的“父亲”一样的角色
Dialogue: 1,0:59:17.76,0:59:20.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们还不知道这一切的缘由
Dialogue: 1,0:59:20.22,0:59:25.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,也不知道乔尔到底做了什么 让那帮人如此急切地想让乔尔死
Dialogue: 1,0:59:25.32,0:59:30.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米不小心看到他们身上衣服写着“WLF”
Dialogue: 1,0:59:30.00,0:59:32.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他以前在火萤组织工作过
Dialogue: 1,0:59:32.79,0:59:35.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,他知道这个缩写的含义是华盛顿解放战线
Dialogue: 1,0:59:35.91,0:59:38.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,说明这是一个在华盛顿州的组织
Dialogue: 1,0:59:38.40,0:59:39.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不废话吗
Dialogue: 1,0:59:39.54,0:59:43.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也给了艾莉下一步的目标
Dialogue: 1,0:59:43.59,0:59:47.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比那帮人可能已经回去了 路途可不短
Dialogue: 1,0:59:47.60,0:59:49.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且还要保证他们还在那 还能找到他们
Dialogue: 1,0:59:49.89,0:59:54.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果你有如此强烈的动机在 那你无论如何都会想试试
Dialogue: 1,0:59:54.73,0:59:59.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像埃比也火急火燎地想杀死乔尔复仇一样
Dialogue: 1,0:59:59.93,1:00:04.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉现在也想去埃比的地盘找她复仇
Dialogue: 1,1:00:04.26,1:00:08.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在汤米想只身前往西雅图找埃比报仇
Dialogue: 1,1:00:08.82,1:00:11.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,玛丽娅显然不会同意他去
Dialogue: 1,1:00:11.31,1:00:15.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,但汤米更深一层的目的是想阻止艾莉去西雅图复仇
Dialogue: 1,1:00:15.54,1:00:19.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,他答应过乔尔无论如何都会照顾艾莉
Dialogue: 1,1:00:19.23,1:00:22.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,而此时 他也知道如果艾莉前往西雅图
Dialogue: 1,1:00:22.29,1:00:24.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,那大概率是有去无回
Dialogue: 1,1:00:24.51,1:00:27.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以汤米宁愿自己搏一把
Dialogue: 1,1:00:27.90,1:00:31.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,留下艾莉 只身前往西雅图为乔尔报仇
Dialogue: 1,1:00:31.77,1:00:33.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉则说要么一起去
Dialogue: 1,1:00:33.69,1:00:36.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,要么让汤米同意自己带着蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,1:00:36.56,1:00:41.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,再带小镇里其他一些人一起去复仇
Dialogue: 1,1:00:41.13,1:00:46.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米肯定不同意 跟艾莉说让她再给自己一天的时间
Dialogue: 1,1:00:46.36,1:00:48.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,让汤米考虑、安排一下
Dialogue: 1,1:00:48.50,1:00:50.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,此时 汤米只是在争取时间
Dialogue: 1,1:00:50.55,1:00:52.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,他已经下定主意要怎样做了
Dialogue: 1,1:00:52.71,1:00:54.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们看到艾莉在乔尔的墓前
Dialogue: 1,1:00:54.75,1:00:56.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段真的很感人
Dialogue: 1,1:00:56.22,1:00:59.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏也再次提醒我们 乔尔已经走了
Dialogue: 1,1:00:59.82,1:01:01.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,其他人的情况我不了解
Dialogue: 1,1:01:01.35,1:01:06.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我自己第一次玩游戏的时候 有一种超现实的感觉
Dialogue: 1,1:01:06.02,1:01:09.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不停对自己说：乔尔肯定还没死
Dialogue: 1,1:01:09.16,1:01:14.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,一方面我们看过预告片里乔尔在西雅图中出现过
Dialogue: 1,1:01:14.23,1:01:16.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一方面 他可是乔尔啊！
Dialogue: 1,1:01:16.74,1:01:21.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,怎么突然间说没就没了啊 应该还有点别的戏份啊
Dialogue: 1,1:01:21.42,1:01:22.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,但真的没了
Dialogue: 1,1:01:22.56,1:01:26.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔死了 他的墓就在这 很遗憾
Dialogue: 1,1:01:26.04,1:01:28.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉之后和蒂娜一起去了乔尔的家
Dialogue: 1,1:01:28.73,1:01:32.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,拿起了他在第一作里就已经坏掉了的手表
Dialogue: 1,1:01:32.48,1:01:36.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,还拿走了他的左轮手枪 游戏剩余部分里你可以一直用
Dialogue: 1,1:01:36.30,1:01:39.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉能拿到这件武器还是很酷的
Dialogue: 1,1:01:39.63,1:01:43.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们还能稍微探索一下乔尔的家
Dialogue: 1,1:01:43.17,1:01:46.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,细节真的非常丰富
Dialogue: 1,1:01:46.95,1:01:49.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,也更加丰满了乔尔这个角色
Dialogue: 1,1:01:49.77,1:01:54.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,他热爱音乐 房间也打理得整整齐齐
Dialogue: 1,1:01:54.66,1:01:58.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,但房间也空旷得令人心酸
Dialogue: 1,1:01:58.02,1:01:59.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,有很多空旷的大房间
Dialogue: 1,1:01:59.97,1:02:01.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许是我过度解读了
Dialogue: 1,1:02:01.74,1:02:04.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我总感觉房子里空余空间这么大
Dialogue: 1,1:02:04.55,1:02:07.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果艾莉想住进来是完全没问题的
Dialogue: 1,1:02:07.17,1:02:13.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像我之前说的 若不是因为两人的情感上的隔阂
Dialogue: 1,1:02:13.76,1:02:17.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉完全没理由住在房子后面的附属房里
Dialogue: 1,1:02:17.01,1:02:23.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外相信我 我们之后还会看到房子里的挂画
Dialogue: 1,1:02:23.52,1:02:30.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔的床还是略显凌乱 床边有一本太空类的杂志和一些书
Dialogue: 1,1:02:30.27,1:02:32.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,他对太空感兴趣 所以在看这方面的书
Dialogue: 1,1:02:32.38,1:02:35.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的很……温馨 很感人
Dialogue: 1,1:02:35.70,1:02:41.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,每每想到乔尔再也不会出现在这间房子里 都感觉心痛不已
Dialogue: 1,1:02:41.10,1:02:42.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,拿上这些东西后
Dialogue: 1,1:02:42.66,1:02:47.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,你走下楼梯 发现玛丽娅和蒂娜在桌前等你
Dialogue: 1,1:02:47.61,1:02:51.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,她告诉你汤米已经自己去复仇了
Dialogue: 1,1:02:51.19,1:02:55.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,还说要把艾莉关起来 不让她跟上来
Dialogue: 1,1:02:55.83,1:02:59.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,玛丽娅为此肯定很苦恼 生气 闹心……
Dialogue: 1,1:02:59.34,1:03:01.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,你能想到的啥词都行
Dialogue: 1,1:03:01.89,1:03:04.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,但最主要的是 她担忧汤米的安全
Dialogue: 1,1:03:04.41,1:03:09.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且她深知如果能送艾莉和蒂娜过去帮助汤米
Dialogue: 1,1:03:09.93,1:03:11.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,那至少能提高成功的概率
Dialogue: 1,1:03:11.91,1:03:17.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以玛丽娅允许艾莉和蒂娜带着马和一些物资离开杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,1:03:17.09,1:03:22.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,条件是要能把汤米完整地、活着带回来
Dialogue: 1,1:03:22.56,1:03:26.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这为你和你操控的角色未来的旅程设定了两个目标
Dialogue: 1,1:03:26.12,1:03:30.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,你要去杀死埃比复仇 还要去救汤米
Dialogue: 1,1:03:30.33,1:03:33.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然汤米可能用不着你来救
Dialogue: 1,1:03:33.39,1:03:36.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且等你到了西雅图还会发现
Dialogue: 1,1:03:36.36,1:03:42.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,这趟旅途全程还会额外增加第三个目标
Dialogue: 1,1:03:42.87,1:03:44.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,这趟旅途全程还会额外增加第三个目标
Dialogue: 1,1:03:44.31,1:03:47.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,我发现他们这样设定多个目标还是很有意思的
Dialogue: 1,1:03:47.24,1:03:51.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这样会让事情看起来很复杂 我很喜欢这样的设定
Dialogue: 1,1:03:51.56,1:03:57.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果目标单一 只要去杀了某个人就行了 就会显得单调
Dialogue: 1,1:03:57.57,1:03:59.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,让游戏不那么有趣
Dialogue: 1,1:03:59.01,1:04:04.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此知道自己需要一次完成很多个目标还是挺有意思的
Dialogue: 1,1:04:04.26,1:04:10.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,至此 我们来到了游戏的核心内容——「西雅图 第1天」
Dialogue: 1,1:04:10.98,1:04:15.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,序章结束了 该开始游玩游戏的最核心部分了
Dialogue: 1,1:04:15.93,1:04:20.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在这之前 我想先和大家聊聊此时我的感受
Dialogue: 1,1:04:20.31,1:04:23.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,我一周目玩到这里 我感觉我充满动力
Dialogue: 1,1:04:23.43,1:04:30.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时内心又觉得充满顾虑 字面意思上的不好的感觉
Dialogue: 1,1:04:30.45,1:04:34.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这类复仇对任何人来说都不会有好下场
Dialogue: 1,1:04:34.62,1:04:42.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不禁去想艾莉最后搞砸了 弄得自己死无葬身之地怎么办
Dialogue: 1,1:04:42.93,1:04:45.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得这也正是关键所在
Dialogue: 1,1:04:45.99,1:04:51.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家需要去融入艾莉 切身体会她的彷徨与疑虑
Dialogue: 1,1:04:51.51,1:04:57.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然 艾莉嘴上说着要去怎样怎样砍死埃比还不带眨眼的
Dialogue: 1,1:04:57.12,1:04:59.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,要让埃比为自己的行为付出代价云云
Dialogue: 1,1:04:59.64,1:05:03.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但艾莉自己还是时不时表现出些许的保留态度
Dialogue: 1,1:05:03.06,1:05:06.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,她深知自己的行为在逻辑上是不合理的
Dialogue: 1,1:05:06.51,1:05:11.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像埃比最初肯定也知道自己一头扎进暴雪中的杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,1:05:11.05,1:05:13.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,也没什么逻辑可言
Dialogue: 1,1:05:13.35,1:05:18.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她们都去做了 因为她们认为这似乎是正确的
Dialogue: 1,1:05:18.21,1:05:20.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是她们坚持下去的原因
Dialogue: 1,1:05:20.19,1:05:23.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一场情感与动机的拉锯战
Dialogue: 1,1:05:23.40,1:05:26.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的冲突才会造就有趣的故事
Dialogue: 1,1:05:26.88,1:05:30.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可以说你对TLOU2这部分故事有自己的见解
Dialogue: 1,1:05:30.96,1:05:33.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,但游戏本身还是有趣的
Dialogue: 1,1:05:33.15,1:05:37.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能剧情不是那种令人开心的爽剧
Dialogue: 1,1:05:37.41,1:05:39.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对我来讲游戏还是很有意思的
Dialogue: 1,1:05:39.45,1:05:43.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能会有人不喜欢 那我也欢迎大家在下面留言
Dialogue: 1,1:05:43.50,1:05:47.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过说真的 可能不喜欢的人早就关掉视频了
Dialogue: 1,1:05:47.37,1:05:50.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果这游戏没有任何一点让你觉得有趣的地方
Dialogue: 1,1:05:50.82,1:05:56.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,你还看了一个多小时序章的测评内容 还没关视频 那你真是纯爷们
Dialogue: 1,1:05:56.49,1:06:02.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,就这样 我们带着寻找埃比的新动力 进入了游戏核心部分的内容
Dialogue: 1,1:06:02.55,1:06:05.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,有着这样的动机驱使我们继续游戏是很有用的
Dialogue: 1,1:06:05.66,1:06:09.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我们即将进入一段节奏非常慢的部分
Dialogue: 1,1:06:09.77,1:06:16.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,说真的 这段里面有些解密内容玩的我都感觉有点腻了
Dialogue: 1,1:06:16.98,1:06:19.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,感觉有点……YUE
Dialogue: 1,1:06:19.14,1:06:20.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过不急 我们稍后会提到
Dialogue: 1,1:06:20.67,1:06:24.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,就这样 我们来到了「西雅图 第1天」
Dialogue: 1,1:06:24.46,1:06:28.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,来西雅图的第一天 主要元素是“大门”
Dialogue: 1,1:06:28.24,1:06:31.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,一开始和蒂娜一边唠嗑一边穿过树林
Dialogue: 1,1:06:31.05,1:06:33.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后你要想办法进入城市的主体部分
Dialogue: 1,1:06:33.75,1:06:36.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 有很多在隔离期结束前建立的军事设施后来都成了废墟
Dialogue: 1,1:06:36.81,1:06:41.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 有很多在隔离期结束前建立的军事设施后来都成了废墟
Dialogue: 1,1:06:41.97,1:06:43.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 你得想办法进去
Dialogue: 1,1:06:43.89,1:06:46.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里有一些可以搜集的补给品
Dialogue: 1,1:06:46.17,1:06:49.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这个区域的主要内容就是解谜
Dialogue: 1,1:06:49.12,1:06:54.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家爬上爬下各种建筑和梯子 从找到的纸条上发现一些数字 输进去
Dialogue: 1,1:06:54.34,1:06:56.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后进入了西雅图市区
Dialogue: 1,1:06:56.49,1:06:59.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,这可能是游戏中我最讨厌的部分了
Dialogue: 1,1:06:59.22,1:07:00.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们充满干劲地来到这里
Dialogue: 1,1:07:00.67,1:07:03.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们想搞定几个人 从他们口中问出一些名字
Dialogue: 1,1:07:03.13,1:07:06.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后再去搞定那些问到的名字
Dialogue: 1,1:07:06.21,1:07:11.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果却卡在这绞尽脑汁去玩什么解谜
Dialogue: 1,1:07:11.07,1:07:14.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,找到写有数字密码的纸条 然后去其他地方
Dialogue: 1,1:07:14.13,1:07:19.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,打开笔记本 翻开纸条 然后手动输入进去
Dialogue: 1,1:07:19.29,1:07:20.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,这可一点意思都没有
Dialogue: 1,1:07:20.70,1:07:25.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,这和玩家此时想要做的事情是完全冲突的
Dialogue: 1,1:07:25.59,1:07:28.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,我理解顽皮狗可能想要在此把节奏放缓
Dialogue: 1,1:07:28.62,1:07:33.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为在游戏序章结束后你可能会有巨大的失落感
Dialogue: 1,1:07:33.18,1:07:37.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是感觉这里或许有更好的处理办法
Dialogue: 1,1:07:37.14,1:07:41.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如多来点战斗环节 比如向你介绍新的感染者
Dialogue: 1,1:07:41.61,1:07:45.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,管他呢 反正啥内容都比这样解谜要好
Dialogue: 1,1:07:45.34,1:07:51.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,接着我们到了市中心 据我的估计 这应该是游戏中最大的单体区域了
Dialogue: 1,1:07:51.00,1:07:54.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,场景非常开放 有大约11个主要地点
Dialogue: 1,1:07:54.30,1:07:58.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少我自己在这片区域内找到了这么多
Dialogue: 1,1:07:58.68,1:08:03.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,包括一个银行 一个犹太教堂 一个法庭 都有很多细节在里面
Dialogue: 1,1:08:03.57,1:08:08.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,银行里面很有趣的是一切刚好定格在一群人准备抢劫的时候
Dialogue: 1,1:08:08.16,1:08:11.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,我喜欢一边看着银行里散落的无数钞票
Dialogue: 1,1:08:11.79,1:08:15.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,一边看艾莉和蒂娜聊着这个时代如果钱还能用她们会怎么花
Dialogue: 1,1:08:15.68,1:08:19.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,一边看艾莉和蒂娜聊着这个时代如果钱还能用她们会怎么花
Dialogue: 1,1:08:19.38,1:08:23.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我必须得说 顽皮狗真的很擅长这种架空世界观的构建
Dialogue: 1,1:08:23.22,1:08:27.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,它会让你思考你目前生活中哪些才是真正重要的
Dialogue: 1,1:08:27.69,1:08:30.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果看视频的你是个瘫在椅子上一心只想着钱的死肥宅
Dialogue: 1,1:08:30.64,1:08:33.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果看视频的你是个瘫在椅子上一心只想着钱的死肥宅
Dialogue: 1,1:08:33.39,1:08:36.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,那当你走进这个钞票如同废纸的末世 肯定会不禁感慨万千
Dialogue: 1,1:08:36.45,1:08:41.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,那当你走进这个钞票如同废纸的末世 肯定会不禁感慨万千
Dialogue: 1,1:08:41.34,1:08:45.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,正是这些琐碎之事才让玩家脑中迸发了思想的火花
Dialogue: 1,1:08:45.41,1:08:49.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,让玩家身临其境般 进入游戏中这样的世界里去
Dialogue: 1,1:08:49.17,1:08:55.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也让顽皮狗非常擅长引导玩家能继续融入故事中去
Dialogue: 1,1:08:55.50,1:08:57.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而在这个章节中我最喜欢的部分
Dialogue: 1,1:08:57.75,1:09:01.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,是音乐商店中的一个可选的互动内容
Dialogue: 1,1:09:01.92,1:09:07.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,基本上如果你在这里与吉他互动 Ellie就会开始弹唱《Take On Me》给Dina听
Dialogue: 1,1:09:07.71,1:09:13.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,它真的很动听 是这个已经很放松的部分中的另一份平静时刻
Dialogue: 1,1:09:13.36,1:09:19.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真的很喜欢 也希望大家能享受这份平静 因为这份平静并不会持续太久
Dialogue: 1,1:09:19.11,1:09:23.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是尽管这部分游戏的故事元素令人印象相当深刻
Dialogue: 1,1:09:23.82,1:09:32.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得你要探索的广阔区域并不像我认为顽皮狗希望的那样令人印象深刻
Dialogue: 1,1:09:32.25,1:09:35.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个这片区域很容易让人联想到《神秘海域：失落的遗产》
Dialogue: 1,1:09:35.76,1:09:39.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗的另一款《神秘海域》系列游戏
Dialogue: 1,1:09:39.12,1:09:42.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,在《失落的遗产》中 游戏给玩家提供了一大片可以探索的区域
Dialogue: 1,1:09:42.81,1:09:44.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这种探索
Dialogue: 1,1:09:44.07,1:09:48.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,本质上都是从一个地方到另一个地方 进行一些战斗
Dialogue: 1,1:09:48.60,1:09:51.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,解开一些谜题 然后再去下一个地方
Dialogue: 1,1:09:51.75,1:09:56.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,它和大家心中所想的“开放世界”还是有些出入的
Dialogue: 1,1:09:56.61,1:10:01.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如《塞尔达传说 旷野之息》里 玩家的确会主动探索地图
Dialogue: 1,1:10:01.23,1:10:03.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然也可能是我的期望值太高了
Dialogue: 1,1:10:03.52,1:10:06.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为顽皮狗说自己在这块区域下了很大功夫
Dialogue: 1,1:10:06.60,1:10:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,说这是他们制作的游戏中场景最大的关卡
Dialogue: 1,1:10:11.52,1:10:15.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这方面也确实相当令人深刻
Dialogue: 1,1:10:15.81,1:10:18.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,但像《荒野大镖客：救赎2》那样
Dialogue: 1,1:10:18.46,1:10:22.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,骑马自由穿过田野也真不是什么了不起的成就
Dialogue: 1,1:10:22.26,1:10:25.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然我不是在顽皮狗和R星之间搞什么一踩一捧
Dialogue: 1,1:10:25.77,1:10:30.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们都是不可多得的游戏制作组
Dialogue: 1,1:10:30.00,1:10:35.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是不禁感觉《荒野大镖客：救赎2》里的骑马和植被
Dialogue: 1,1:10:35.37,1:10:42.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,在开放世界当中 相比晚两年的TLOU2还是要强得多
Dialogue: 1,1:10:42.35,1:10:47.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能是我太挑了 也可能只是我个人的喜好罢了
Dialogue: 1,1:10:47.31,1:10:48.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,欢迎在评论区留言讨论
Dialogue: 1,1:10:48.90,1:10:54.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我真的感觉两款游戏在这方面有很大差别 而且《荒野大镖客》更占上风
Dialogue: 1,1:10:54.54,1:11:00.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 玩家继续探索 终于打开了被锁住的大门
Dialogue: 1,1:11:00.72,1:11:04.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,感觉好安静 街上也没有WLF的人 骑马穿过检查点就好了
Dialogue: 1,1:11:04.77,1:11:07.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后就……
Dialogue: 1,1:11:41.61,1:11:48.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉醒来后 我们发现她被捆在一所名为伊斯特布鲁克的小学的桌子腿上
Dialogue: 1,1:11:48.96,1:11:52.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不是重点 重点是艾莉现在被劫持为人质
Dialogue: 1,1:11:52.80,1:11:55.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,而蒂娜貌似已经脱身了
Dialogue: 1,1:11:55.02,1:12:01.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉马上要被撕票 而这时蒂娜从天而降……就是……没降落好
Dialogue: 1,1:12:03.09,1:12:07.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,你眼看着这个人就要勒死蒂娜 自己却束手无策
Dialogue: 1,1:12:07.59,1:12:09.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段做的真的很棒
Dialogue: 1,1:12:09.48,1:12:12.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,我玩这段的时候感觉心都要蹦出来了
Dialogue: 1,1:12:12.96,1:12:15.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终 你用腿够到了一块碎玻璃
Dialogue: 1,1:12:15.39,1:12:16.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,用它割断绑绳
Dialogue: 1,1:12:16.86,1:12:20.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后艾莉冲上前去 解决了正在攻击蒂娜的人
Dialogue: 1,1:12:20.10,1:12:23.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,随后她从那个男子的口袋中找到了一封信和一张照片
Dialogue: 1,1:12:23.52,1:12:26.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,稍后会很重要
Dialogue: 1,1:12:26.04,1:12:29.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来是一系列和人类敌人的战斗
Dialogue: 1,1:12:29.97,1:12:35.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的节奏变换处理得很棒 让你从之前一直面对的感染者一转面对人类敌人
Dialogue: 1,1:12:35.49,1:12:37.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,让你不得不改变作战策略
Dialogue: 1,1:12:37.92,1:12:41.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如从现在开始 你需要注意手电筒的灯光
Dialogue: 1,1:12:41.46,1:12:45.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,面对绝大多数的感染者 你是不需要管手电筒开关的
Dialogue: 1,1:12:45.32,1:12:48.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为它们看不见 或者不会有反应
Dialogue: 1,1:12:48.70,1:12:51.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,但人类敌人肯定看得见
Dialogue: 1,1:12:51.21,1:12:54.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,人类敌人视觉更好 但听觉更差
Dialogue: 1,1:12:54.03,1:12:58.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且战术上他们还会在需要的时候包抄偷袭你
Dialogue: 1,1:12:58.71,1:13:03.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时他们也会对一些异常声响做出敏感的反应
Dialogue: 1,1:13:03.15,1:13:07.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在生还者难度下 如果你没有子弹了 那局面会很难受
Dialogue: 1,1:13:07.59,1:13:13.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,那时候你只能扔个瓶子然后走为上计
Dialogue: 1,1:13:13.31,1:13:15.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者躺平 祈祷他们能绕开走
Dialogue: 1,1:13:15.78,1:13:21.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,我明白在这样一种末世下你做什么都不方便
Dialogue: 1,1:13:21.21,1:13:24.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,但真的很让人闹心
Dialogue: 1,1:13:24.12,1:13:25.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,一路杀过去 转危为安后
Dialogue: 1,1:13:25.74,1:13:30.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉拿出了从攻击蒂娜的人身上搜出的文件和照片
Dialogue: 1,1:13:30.57,1:13:36.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是利娅给乔丹男朋友的照片 而你刚杀死的那个人就是乔丹
Dialogue: 1,1:13:36.32,1:13:40.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,但抱歉了各位 照片上有块血污挡住了关键信息
Dialogue: 1,1:13:40.32,1:13:42.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以暂停视频肯定没用啦
Dialogue: 1,1:13:42.84,1:13:47.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在来看 利娅刚好也是埃比“杀戮之旅”的成员
Dialogue: 1,1:13:47.46,1:13:52.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,又一个巧合 引导艾莉前往13频道电视台寻找利娅
Dialogue: 1,1:13:52.44,1:13:55.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,而利娅有可能帮助艾莉找到埃比
Dialogue: 1,1:13:55.77,1:14:03.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和蒂娜还从WLF成员的对话中听说了这个叫伊萨克的人
Dialogue: 1,1:14:03.15,1:14:10.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然我们对这个人的消息了解得不多
Dialogue: 1,1:14:10.14,1:14:15.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我们知道的是他貌似负责运营WLF 而且权力很大
Dialogue: 1,1:14:15.66,1:14:18.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家都听他的 还都很害怕他
Dialogue: 1,1:14:18.21,1:14:23.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗的游戏按照惯例会将此作为后来与伊萨克的Boss战的铺垫
Dialogue: 1,1:14:23.16,1:14:26.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,既然提到他了 那他在游戏后面肯定是个关键角色了对吧？
Dialogue: 1,1:14:26.82,1:14:28.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,恭喜你答错了
Dialogue: 1,1:14:28.65,1:14:33.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的事情还会在未来另一个角色身上发生 可能是为续作之类的内容做准备
Dialogue: 1,1:14:33.24,1:14:40.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,但就伊萨克和另一位即将登场女性角色来说 这样的事情的确没有发生
Dialogue: 1,1:14:40.26,1:14:45.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之接下来艾莉和蒂娜继续前往城市中心 寻找13频道电视台
Dialogue: 1,1:14:45.00,1:14:49.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,追捕利娅 想办法从她那里获得更多埃比的消息
Dialogue: 1,1:14:49.08,1:14:53.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,你继续推进 顺手杀了一堆WLF士兵和感染者
Dialogue: 1,1:14:53.67,1:14:58.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,你发现地上有绊雷 不禁想起一代里的比尔
Dialogue: 1,1:14:58.29,1:15:03.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在这里它们除了减慢游戏探索速度之外似乎没有任何作用
Dialogue: 1,1:15:03.99,1:15:09.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,就我个人而言我很快发现这些绊雷的乐趣所在——它们就是单纯的烦
Dialogue: 1,1:15:09.30,1:15:13.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,偶尔用一些新的不同的东西来为单调的游戏调味的想法是好的
Dialogue: 1,1:15:13.68,1:15:15.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如这些绊雷
Dialogue: 1,1:15:15.63,1:15:20.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,而在这里 这些绊雷并没有在游戏剩余部分中出现
Dialogue: 1,1:15:20.19,1:15:26.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们只是一种不会让你形成游戏中新的习惯行为的烦人道具
Dialogue: 1,1:15:26.76,1:15:30.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说 在大多数游戏中 制作者向你介绍一个新的游戏元素
Dialogue: 1,1:15:30.90,1:15:33.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,其原因是这个元素会在游戏的剩余部分中用到
Dialogue: 1,1:15:33.75,1:15:36.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你需要学会掌握它
Dialogue: 1,1:15:36.72,1:15:42.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在这里 这个元素用的很少 而且很多可以避开
Dialogue: 1,1:15:42.24,1:15:45.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然了 这可能是我自己的小癖好罢了
Dialogue: 1,1:15:45.27,1:15:49.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来你会遇到游戏中最棒的收集品
Dialogue: 1,1:15:53.97,1:15:55.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后你继续探索
Dialogue: 1,1:15:55.62,1:15:58.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,来到一处疤脸帮某种仪式的事后现场
Dialogue: 1,1:15:58.83,1:16:03.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,有很多被吊起来开肠破肚的尸体
Dialogue: 1,1:16:03.43,1:16:07.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然不清楚具体是什么时候发生的 但肯定是最近
Dialogue: 1,1:16:07.86,1:16:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我相信肯定有人像我一样这时候突然意识到
Dialogue: 1,1:16:11.52,1:16:17.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使找到利娅也不太可能对你寻找埃比有什么帮助
Dialogue: 1,1:16:17.07,1:16:20.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其疤脸帮已经弄得这里一片狼藉了
Dialogue: 1,1:16:20.34,1:16:24.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,就算她还在电视台里 那也很可能已经死了
Dialogue: 1,1:16:24.02,1:16:28.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,果不其然 你来到电视台顶楼一间办公室内
Dialogue: 1,1:16:28.50,1:16:31.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,发现她已经被射成刺猬了
Dialogue: 1,1:16:31.08,1:16:35.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,但没事 我们可以强凑巧合呀
Dialogue: 1,1:16:35.64,1:16:39.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不 艾莉决定打开利娅行军床下的手提兜
Dialogue: 1,1:16:39.51,1:16:48.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后恰好有每一位去杰克逊小镇追杀乔尔的成员照片
Dialogue: 1,1:16:48.45,1:16:51.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然 他们把整件事都记录得明明白白
Dialogue: 1,1:16:51.60,1:16:54.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我才管他们这趟叫“杀戮之旅”
Dialogue: 1,1:16:54.24,1:16:58.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这可能是，我觉得不止可能，它就是
Dialogue: 1,1:16:58.68,1:17:03.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,靠巧合推动游戏剧情发展的最糟糕的例子
Dialogue: 1,1:17:03.36,1:17:07.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们需要让艾莉牢牢把这些人的名字和长相记在脑海中
Dialogue: 1,1:17:07.30,1:17:10.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们需要让艾莉牢牢把这些人的名字和长相记在脑海中
Dialogue: 1,1:17:10.44,1:17:14.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样她就能问别人这人是谁 这人在哪
Dialogue: 1,1:17:14.85,1:17:19.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们完全想不出一个让艾莉通过更合理的手段获得这些信息的办法
Dialogue: 1,1:17:19.14,1:17:26.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以就只好让她直接去“碰巧”找到一个被遗弃的包
Dialogue: 1,1:17:26.04,1:17:31.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后包里还刚好被一个有工作任务的女子放置了所有的照片
Dialogue: 1,1:17:31.35,1:17:35.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且利娅甚至不应该在电视台呆很久
Dialogue: 1,1:17:35.49,1:17:39.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我完全搞不懂为啥她要随身带着所有这些照片……
Dialogue: 1,1:17:39.73,1:17:41.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,实在想不通
Dialogue: 1,1:17:41.55,1:17:43.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,算了 反正想也没有用
Dialogue: 1,1:17:43.43,1:17:48.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,在你找到照片后不久 WLF的人就来了 以为你是疤脸帮
Dialogue: 1,1:17:48.65,1:17:51.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,冲进大楼想要找到你们俩
Dialogue: 1,1:17:51.51,1:17:53.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,你和他们一番战斗后逃往了地下
Dialogue: 1,1:17:53.67,1:17:57.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终来到了地铁系统中
Dialogue: 1,1:17:57.12,1:17:59.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段交战看起来挺难的
Dialogue: 1,1:17:59.64,1:18:02.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,但实际上想打过去还是挺简单的
Dialogue: 1,1:18:02.56,1:18:08.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如视频中的例子 把燃烧瓶扔准 效果刚刚的
Dialogue: 1,1:18:08.19,1:18:09.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,当你进入地铁
Dialogue: 1,1:18:09.54,1:18:16.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会遇到新的名为跛行者的感染者 会走到你面前释放一种酸雾
Dialogue: 1,1:18:16.36,1:18:21.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,在普通难度下 我其实感觉它们令人失望的简单
Dialogue: 1,1:18:21.87,1:18:25.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,简直完全不符合我的预期
Dialogue: 1,1:18:25.65,1:18:29.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们抱住你的时候完全没有叫声听起来那么吓人
Dialogue: 1,1:18:29.64,1:18:35.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,但到了二周目生还者难度 这玩意虐你简直跟玩一样
Dialogue: 1,1:18:35.55,1:18:39.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然可能只有我自己会在之前觉得应付跛行者不难
Dialogue: 1,1:18:39.45,1:18:42.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能是我对它期待太高了
Dialogue: 1,1:18:42.32,1:18:47.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为有证据表明顽皮狗希望玩家能在这里遇到一些困难
Dialogue: 1,1:18:47.10,1:18:49.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如蒂娜这样锁门的动作
Dialogue: 1,1:18:49.62,1:18:51.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,我第一次玩还感觉有点奇怪
Dialogue: 1,1:18:51.80,1:18:55.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为门那边已经什么都没有了
Dialogue: 1,1:18:55.11,1:18:57.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,所有感染者都死了
Dialogue: 1,1:18:57.12,1:19:01.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,我为了防止它们跑出来 把它们都杀掉了
Dialogue: 1,1:19:01.74,1:19:03.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在我二周目游戏中
Dialogue: 1,1:19:03.75,1:19:09.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,我把绝大多数感染者留在里面 潜行通过了此区域
Dialogue: 1,1:19:09.30,1:19:13.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样 把门锁上这个操作就很合理了
Dialogue: 1,1:19:13.47,1:19:17.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在一周目普通难度下 杀死所有感染者后
Dialogue: 1,1:19:17.55,1:19:22.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,看蒂娜还去锁门的动作就显得怪怪的
Dialogue: 1,1:19:22.32,1:19:25.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然无关痛痒 但就是感觉怪怪的
Dialogue: 1,1:19:25.44,1:19:28.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这是一个很好的例子
Dialogue: 1,1:19:28.72,1:19:33.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,能够说明顽皮狗可能很希望玩家能潜行通过这片区域
Dialogue: 1,1:19:33.63,1:19:36.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和蒂娜继续穿过这些隧道
Dialogue: 1,1:19:36.51,1:19:41.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段场景玩的时候总能让我回想起一代游戏的内容
Dialogue: 1,1:19:41.70,1:19:45.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为在一代里 艾莉是不会游泳的
Dialogue: 1,1:19:45.48,1:19:50.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔就得先去找漂浮物才能把艾莉送到目的地
Dialogue: 1,1:19:50.40,1:19:52.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,而到了二代 艾莉会的东西多了
Dialogue: 1,1:19:52.50,1:19:56.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,真要说帮助 那也只能是艾莉去帮蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,1:19:56.16,1:20:02.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在探索了几条这样的隧道并爬过一些车厢后 其中一节车厢倒塌了
Dialogue: 1,1:20:02.01,1:20:08.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后她们被一群感染者扑倒 艾莉摔了一跤 她的面具摔碎了
Dialogue: 1,1:20:08.07,1:20:10.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致艾莉完全暴露在孢子中
Dialogue: 1,1:20:10.08,1:20:14.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜显然吓坏了 以为艾莉死定了
Dialogue: 1,1:20:14.58,1:20:17.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉一边说她没事 先赶紧跑到地面上要紧
Dialogue: 1,1:20:17.52,1:20:21.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,一边告诉蒂娜千万不要摘掉面具给两人共用
Dialogue: 1,1:20:21.66,1:20:24.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,你俩一路连滚带爬总算到了地面层
Dialogue: 1,1:20:24.51,1:20:29.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,关好门 看到马路对面有一家老剧院
Dialogue: 1,1:20:29.10,1:20:30.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们决定去那歇脚
Dialogue: 1,1:20:30.84,1:20:37.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,幸好这里防守还算牢靠 门也可以从里面上锁
Dialogue: 1,1:20:37.03,1:20:41.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和蒂娜进入剧院 准备在此歇息
Dialogue: 1,1:20:41.16,1:20:45.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜显然很悲伤 因为她以为艾莉要死了
Dialogue: 1,1:20:45.99,1:20:49.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟她刚眼睁睁看着艾莉吸入了孢子
Dialogue: 1,1:20:49.02,1:20:53.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,而对于据她所知的任何人类来说这无异于被宣判了死刑
Dialogue: 1,1:20:53.25,1:20:57.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,但艾莉是个例外 她没事
Dialogue: 1,1:20:57.87,1:21:02.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,这时艾莉再一次解释了她自己有免疫的事情
Dialogue: 1,1:21:02.76,1:21:05.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,她之前曾经和蒂娜在尤金的地下室大麻屋里解释过
Dialogue: 1,1:21:05.67,1:21:10.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,她之前曾经和蒂娜在尤金的地下室大麻屋里解释过
Dialogue: 1,1:21:10.02,1:21:12.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而当时蒂娜看起来并没有相信
Dialogue: 1,1:21:12.85,1:21:16.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,她以为艾莉只是在骗她 开了个很黑色幽默的玩笑
Dialogue: 1,1:21:16.44,1:21:20.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,但现在蒂娜明白过来这可能是真的
Dialogue: 1,1:21:20.19,1:21:24.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然我感觉蒂娜好像没太把这当回事
Dialogue: 1,1:21:24.69,1:21:31.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,她的爱人的天赋可是免疫一种能感染地球上所有人类的真菌
Dialogue: 1,1:21:32.07,1:21:34.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她好像丝毫不感兴趣
Dialogue: 1,1:21:34.41,1:21:38.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 我不确定她在整个游戏后来是否还提起过此事
Dialogue: 1,1:21:38.73,1:21:42.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,哪怕是游戏后面的场景片段里
Dialogue: 1,1:21:42.06,1:21:43.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点就有点奇怪
Dialogue: 1,1:21:43.29,1:21:46.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,我明白这个故事流程里涉及到很多内容
Dialogue: 1,1:21:46.80,1:21:50.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,也有可能某个片段她们更深入地交流了这方面的事情
Dialogue: 1,1:21:50.40,1:21:53.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,但最终被减掉了……我也不确定
Dialogue: 1,1:21:53.43,1:21:58.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之我感觉蒂娜没再跟艾莉提起她的免疫这件事是很奇怪的
Dialogue: 1,1:21:58.62,1:22:03.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时还是在剧院里 蒂娜说她感觉自己好像怀孕了
Dialogue: 1,1:22:03.93,1:22:08.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为之前蒂娜和杰西在一起过 然后分手了 一周后又和艾莉亲亲了
Dialogue: 1,1:22:08.85,1:22:12.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,那显然孩子是杰西的
Dialogue: 1,1:22:12.30,1:22:15.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,这又让这些人之间的关系变得更加复杂
Dialogue: 1,1:22:15.87,1:22:19.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人对这个剧情丝毫不感觉意外
Dialogue: 1,1:22:19.05,1:22:24.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,前面三四个小时的游戏内容铺垫下来
Dialogue: 1,1:22:24.36,1:22:26.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,加之如果你完整读过艾莉的日记
Dialogue: 1,1:22:26.73,1:22:29.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你可能比艾莉知道得还早
Dialogue: 1,1:22:29.81,1:22:34.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜吐了几次 说是自己感觉不太好 太累了
Dialogue: 1,1:22:34.74,1:22:40.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,把这些归于一路的血腥厮杀 但实际上只是孕吐
Dialogue: 1,1:22:40.62,1:22:48.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,此外 在听到埃比和欧文讨论欧文的爱人梅尔 以及她的怀孕问题后
Dialogue: 1,1:22:48.87,1:22:50.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,基本上就石锤了
Dialogue: 1,1:22:50.63,1:22:55.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗想让艾莉这边阵营某个人也怀孕这件事
Dialogue: 1,1:22:55.05,1:22:57.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样顽皮狗才可以在之后构建两条平行的故事
Dialogue: 1,1:22:57.69,1:23:00.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,你看我说什么来着
Dialogue: 1,1:23:00.51,1:23:03.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 艾莉最后让蒂娜去睡觉 自己则走开了
Dialogue: 1,1:23:03.81,1:23:07.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段尴尬的谈话过后 你想办法为剧院恢复了供电
Dialogue: 1,1:23:07.80,1:23:11.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,并在技师的休息间里偶然找到了一个收音机
Dialogue: 1,1:23:11.10,1:23:15.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,它坏掉了 艾莉很郁闷 于是给了收音机一巴掌
Dialogue: 1,1:23:15.12,1:23:20.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后刚好就发现了进入剧院里面的钥匙
Dialogue: 1,1:23:20.76,1:23:23.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不明白为什么钥匙会出现在收音机下面
Dialogue: 1,1:23:23.34,1:23:27.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,但安排让沮丧的艾莉给机器一巴掌可真方便啊
Dialogue: 1,1:23:27.59,1:23:29.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为不然她可就拿不到钥匙了呀
Dialogue: 1,1:23:29.40,1:23:35.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,随便吧 你们懂的 我又开始抱怨游戏里的巧合了
Dialogue: 1,1:23:35.72,1:23:37.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们理解了就好 我们继续
Dialogue: 1,1:23:37.91,1:23:39.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,你在剧院的后台找到一把吉他
Dialogue: 1,1:23:39.71,1:23:43.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,并弹奏了在之前的闪回中乔尔给艾莉弹、还要教艾莉的同一首歌
Dialogue: 1,1:23:43.95,1:23:46.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,并弹奏了在之前的闪回中乔尔给艾莉弹、还要教艾莉的同一首歌
Dialogue: 1,1:23:46.14,1:23:49.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉弹了几段 然后游戏又切入了一段闪回
Dialogue: 1,1:23:49.83,1:23:53.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能是整个游戏里我最喜欢的闪回了
Dialogue: 1,1:23:53.43,1:23:55.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,画面中是乔尔和艾莉
Dialogue: 1,1:23:55.32,1:23:57.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,时间应该是艾莉的生日
Dialogue: 1,1:23:57.18,1:24:00.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔要带她去找她的生日礼物
Dialogue: 1,1:24:00.24,1:24:05.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段内容除了温馨就是感动
Dialogue: 1,1:24:05.16,1:24:09.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔找到了这样一个门口有个大恐龙的博物馆
Dialogue: 1,1:24:09.16,1:24:12.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他知道艾莉梦想是见一见恐龙
Dialogue: 1,1:24:12.63,1:24:17.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,她还有个梦想就是去太空
Dialogue: 1,1:24:17.49,1:24:19.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以乔尔还带她去了航天展区
Dialogue: 1,1:24:19.98,1:24:24.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉可以戴上头盔 进入真实的阿波罗指令舱
Dialogue: 1,1:24:24.84,1:24:30.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔之后也进去了 给了艾莉一盒磁带让她听
Dialogue: 1,1:24:30.04,1:24:34.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉一边听一边想象自己坐着火箭起飞前往太空
Dialogue: 1,1:24:34.47,1:24:40.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段看着很像在一代DLC《最后生还者：遗落》里
Dialogue: 1,1:24:40.70,1:24:45.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和莱莉脑补玩街机游戏的场景
Dialogue: 1,1:24:45.15,1:24:48.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,机器显然没法玩了 因为已经坏好久了
Dialogue: 1,1:24:48.54,1:24:53.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,但莱莉让艾莉闭上眼睛 脑补自己描述的画面
Dialogue: 1,1:24:53.34,1:24:57.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这两个场景如此相近肯定不是巧合
Dialogue: 1,1:24:57.63,1:24:59.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个场景非常的简单
Dialogue: 1,1:24:59.52,1:25:07.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这只是为了进一步确定乔尔和艾莉有很深的羁绊 也非常关心彼此
Dialogue: 1,1:25:07.26,1:25:10.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时 两人的关系也非常复杂
Dialogue: 1,1:25:10.35,1:25:15.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这段闪回的最后 你在墙上看到了一个涂鸦
Dialogue: 1,1:25:15.87,1:25:21.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用说 这明显是乔尔和艾莉都不想讨论的事
Dialogue: 1,1:25:21.27,1:25:22.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是俩人直接回去了
Dialogue: 1,1:25:22.62,1:25:25.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后 我们来到了「西雅图 第2天」
Dialogue: 1,1:25:25.29,1:25:27.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,西雅图第2天开始
Dialogue: 1,1:25:27.39,1:25:31.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉在剧院醒来后看到蒂娜在放收音机的房间里吐
Dialogue: 1,1:25:31.91,1:25:36.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,算是对闪回之前剧情内容的一次挺直接的提醒
Dialogue: 1,1:25:36.72,1:25:40.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜一直在监听电台 破译WLF的通讯内容
Dialogue: 1,1:25:40.58,1:25:44.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,想要找出追杀乔尔那帮人的可能位置
Dialogue: 1,1:25:44.47,1:25:51.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜和艾莉在WLF广播中听到在14区有一个枪手
Dialogue: 1,1:25:51.66,1:25:57.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们猜测这个14区就是不远的希尔科列斯特 艾莉决定亲自去调查一番
Dialogue: 1,1:25:57.03,1:26:00.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们认为这个枪手就是汤米 毕竟……还能是谁啊？
Dialogue: 1,1:26:00.48,1:26:05.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,抱歉 是我家猫在我键盘上乱打的 不关我的事
Dialogue: 1,1:26:05.67,1:26:08.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,但……反正肯定真不是汤米啦
Dialogue: 1,1:26:08.49,1:26:11.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,你操控艾莉继续穿过几个不同的区域
Dialogue: 1,1:26:11.30,1:26:14.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,和各种WLF的人作战 搜刮各种建筑
Dialogue: 1,1:26:15.12,1:26:17.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,大约三十分钟无事发生的探索后
Dialogue: 1,1:26:17.78,1:26:24.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,所有WLF似乎瞬间和艾莉一起涌向了一个远处冒烟的地方
Dialogue: 1,1:26:24.52,1:26:27.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里的关卡设计真的很棒
Dialogue: 1,1:26:27.15,1:26:32.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里使用了远处某个可见物体来引导玩家继续进行关卡
Dialogue: 1,1:26:32.73,1:26:37.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样设计很棒 而且顽皮狗使用类似的设计已经很久了
Dialogue: 1,1:26:37.66,1:26:39.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们非常擅长于此
Dialogue: 1,1:26:39.69,1:26:42.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里的一些关卡也非常难
Dialogue: 1,1:26:42.54,1:26:47.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其在高难度设定下 难度的峰值会急剧增加
Dialogue: 1,1:26:47.67,1:26:54.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里我想说的是如果你之前没有节约 就很容易陷入没有弹药进退两难的地步
Dialogue: 1,1:26:54.24,1:26:57.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此你必须处处节省
Dialogue: 1,1:26:57.09,1:27:00.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,但问题在于一周目下你并不知道
Dialogue: 1,1:27:00.13,1:27:02.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,弹药会消耗如此之快
Dialogue: 1,1:27:02.64,1:27:03.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,你不可能预知此事
Dialogue: 1,1:27:03.96,1:27:09.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你会一直省着弹药 一枪都不想开
Dialogue: 1,1:27:09.48,1:27:12.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果你一直这样小心翼翼处处节约的话
Dialogue: 1,1:27:12.57,1:27:17.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,就意味着你的游戏行为不会有任何改变
Dialogue: 1,1:27:17.10,1:27:18.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会一直不使用自己的弹药
Dialogue: 1,1:27:18.78,1:27:21.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后这个游戏就慢慢变成了一个近战肉搏游戏
Dialogue: 1,1:27:21.30,1:27:26.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种不想用弹药的游戏行为我在很多恐怖游戏里见过
Dialogue: 1,1:27:26.46,1:27:29.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其是那些弹药稀缺的游戏
Dialogue: 1,1:27:29.82,1:27:36.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这样挺怪的 因为我认为这并不算是好的游戏体验
Dialogue: 1,1:27:36.29,1:27:40.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这会让玩家无法参与到多样的游戏机制中去
Dialogue: 1,1:27:40.22,1:27:42.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们害怕如果随随便便使用了弹药
Dialogue: 1,1:27:42.36,1:27:45.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,就会很快耗光弹药 之后就很尴尬了
Dialogue: 1,1:27:45.99,1:27:51.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我也能理解如果彻底抛弃这样的游戏系统又会有一种因噎废食的感觉
Dialogue: 1,1:27:51.69,1:27:54.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 艾莉来到了冒烟的地方
Dialogue: 1,1:27:54.57,1:27:58.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,在WLF的地盘上或杀穿 或潜行
Dialogue: 1,1:27:58.26,1:28:00.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终解锁了弓箭
Dialogue: 1,1:28:00.45,1:28:04.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这可能是游戏中我最喜欢的武器了
Dialogue: 1,1:28:04.44,1:28:10.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,它不会发出声响 根据射中的位置和游戏难度的不同还有可能回收弓箭
Dialogue: 1,1:28:10.86,1:28:14.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之我喜欢这款武器 它真的很好用
Dialogue: 1,1:28:14.61,1:28:19.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉来到了冒烟的地方下 然后……
Dialogue: 1,1:28:48.00,1:28:53.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这实在是太怪了……因为……
Dialogue: 1,1:28:53.02,1:28:56.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,据我所知艾莉回头看见的应该是乔尔才对
Dialogue: 1,1:28:56.97,1:29:01.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以当我看到预告片里的画面即将发生的时候 真的满脑子都是问号
Dialogue: 1,1:29:01.64,1:29:03.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也知道乔尔已经死了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:03.69,1:29:05.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,那他怎么可能会回来拯救艾莉呢？
Dialogue: 1,1:29:05.79,1:29:08.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,但最后明白了 原来是杰西
Dialogue: 1,1:29:08.88,1:29:13.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我感觉他们选择用这种方法迷惑大家实在是太怪了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:13.02,1:29:17.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我们都以为这里出现的会是乔尔
Dialogue: 1,1:29:17.07,1:29:18.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为预告片里都放了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:18.87,1:29:23.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果出现的是……感觉真的……太怪了……我感觉太怪了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:23.07,1:29:24.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,我感觉我都无语了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:24.30,1:29:27.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你有更多相关的信息 请务必在评论区告诉我
Dialogue: 1,1:29:27.06,1:29:29.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就是……觉得怪 已经不知道说什么了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:29.64,1:29:33.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 艾莉和杰西想方设法偷了辆车逃跑了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:33.12,1:29:39.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后一段流畅的战斗后车子开进河里了 这段发售前也泄露过
Dialogue: 1,1:29:39.48,1:29:43.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段战斗简直是如丝般顺滑 不只是因为他们把车开水里去了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:43.47,1:29:47.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得打磨得非常棒 观感非常震撼
Dialogue: 1,1:29:47.76,1:29:51.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当然了 毕竟这是顽皮狗的游戏嘛
Dialogue: 1,1:29:51.78,1:29:55.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,你把杰西带了回去 也带回了成吨的尴尬
Dialogue: 1,1:29:55.77,1:29:59.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉自己先回去了 因为她被尬得实在绷不住了
Dialogue: 1,1:29:59.07,1:30:03.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟艾莉的女朋友的孩子的爸爸出现在面前
Dialogue: 1,1:30:03.54,1:30:05.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得她很难能绷住
Dialogue: 1,1:30:05.44,1:30:10.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,随着艾莉慢慢往回走 我们来到了下一个闪回场景 这个场景实际上非常简单
Dialogue: 1,1:30:10.56,1:30:14.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉先是和汤米学习狙击枪的使用
Dialogue: 1,1:30:14.10,1:30:17.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后和乔尔去音像店的路上探索一家旅馆
Dialogue: 1,1:30:17.73,1:30:19.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的安排还是挺随意的
Dialogue: 1,1:30:19.14,1:30:25.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为狙击枪其实并不是艾莉整个游戏里的主要武器
Dialogue: 1,1:30:25.11,1:30:31.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,但游戏在此教玩家使用狙击枪还是有原因的
Dialogue: 1,1:30:31.02,1:30:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过我稍后会细讲
Dialogue: 1,1:30:33.52,1:30:40.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米的狙击教学结束后 你和他骑马来到山脚下 发现乔尔正坐在那
Dialogue: 1,1:30:40.08,1:30:45.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,你打算和他一起去音像店找找有没有吉他弦
Dialogue: 1,1:30:45.66,1:30:52.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,一个冷知识：原本这里的剧情安排是完全不同的另一种内容
Dialogue: 1,1:30:52.53,1:30:56.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,原来的剧情是 艾莉上完了汤米的狙击课
Dialogue: 1,1:30:56.55,1:31:03.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,打算和乔尔去见他的女朋友 就住在沿着路走不远的地方
Dialogue: 1,1:31:03.21,1:31:08.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们打算骑马过去 到了以后发现乔尔的女朋友刚刚被咬了
Dialogue: 1,1:31:08.76,1:31:11.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后他们不得不做出一些非常艰难的选择
Dialogue: 1,1:31:11.46,1:31:15.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,几个人来回争论了一下接下来该做什么
Dialogue: 1,1:31:15.15,1:31:19.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后乔尔和他女朋友让艾莉去小溪边取一些干净的水来
Dialogue: 1,1:31:19.49,1:31:23.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后艾莉一出门 就听见砰的一声枪响
Dialogue: 1,1:31:23.01,1:31:27.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后乔尔走了出来 大家都知道发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,1:31:27.00,1:31:29.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们都知道……乔尔的女朋友死了
Dialogue: 1,1:31:29.79,1:31:34.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能是乔尔帮忙结束了她的痛苦
Dialogue: 1,1:31:34.11,1:31:39.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能是她不想让乔尔做这个艰难的决定 于是自我了断了
Dialogue: 1,1:31:39.63,1:31:41.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们都知道这样的结果是什么
Dialogue: 1,1:31:41.76,1:31:45.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 这将是一个非常感人的时刻
Dialogue: 1,1:31:45.60,1:31:50.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且能看到乔尔和艾莉一起经历这些还是很有趣的
Dialogue: 1,1:31:50.85,1:31:56.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,他再次经历了失去至爱的时刻 而这次有艾莉陪他
Dialogue: 1,1:31:56.07,1:32:03.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,但显然 根据游戏实际内容 和尼尔·德鲁克曼等一众编剧的评论
Dialogue: 1,1:32:03.81,1:32:07.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段被删改成当前的内容了
Dialogue: 1,1:32:07.18,1:32:11.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人从一个废弃旅馆中穿过 抄近道去音像店
Dialogue: 1,1:32:11.07,1:32:16.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为制作人认为之前那样安排太偏离故事重点了
Dialogue: 1,1:32:16.35,1:32:21.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说 这部游戏是讲艾莉的 不是讲乔尔的
Dialogue: 1,1:32:21.33,1:32:28.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,而如果这段场景过于关注乔尔 那会给人感觉这个游戏是只关注他俩的
Dialogue: 1,1:32:28.56,1:32:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,而不是关于乔尔和艾莉、只能控制艾莉的游戏 当然大家怎么理解都好
Dialogue: 1,1:32:33.52,1:32:36.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们穿过一间间客房 清理了大量感染者
Dialogue: 1,1:32:36.42,1:32:40.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,感觉颇有第一代游戏那味 感觉很不错
Dialogue: 1,1:32:40.23,1:32:44.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,在酒店里 乔尔还坚持让艾莉戴上防毒面具
Dialogue: 1,1:32:44.79,1:32:47.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使她对孢子免疫
Dialogue: 1,1:32:47.67,1:32:50.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉问为何要多此一举
Dialogue: 1,1:32:50.04,1:32:52.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟旅馆里没有别人
Dialogue: 1,1:32:52.56,1:32:57.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔解释说 如果有人看到她 一定会引来相当多不必要的麻烦
Dialogue: 1,1:32:57.60,1:33:00.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以为了避免这些 她还是戴上了
Dialogue: 1,1:33:00.66,1:33:05.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也解释了我们在之前和其它场景里那样看到艾莉戴着面具的原因
Dialogue: 1,1:33:05.85,1:33:11.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,她听从乔尔的要求一直戴着面具 因为她不想让其他人发现她的免疫能力
Dialogue: 1,1:33:11.28,1:33:13.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这样会带来太多的麻烦
Dialogue: 1,1:33:13.47,1:33:22.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者甚至还要费劲去按乔尔的说法去解释在火萤那发生的事
Dialogue: 1,1:33:22.20,1:33:26.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,但又一次和乔尔解决了一堆感染者和一个小boss
Dialogue: 1,1:33:26.97,1:33:32.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,让人联想到第一场游戏的感动 并牵动了我所有的心弦之后
Dialogue: 1,1:33:32.73,1:33:36.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们最终找到了几个月前离开杰克逊小镇的一对夫妇
Dialogue: 1,1:33:36.68,1:33:40.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,引出了两人关于在医院最后发生了什么的对话
Dialogue: 1,1:33:40.47,1:33:44.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,不幸的是 乔尔又选择了说谎
Dialogue: 1,1:34:27.68,1:34:30.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,镜头回到在剧院包扎伤口的艾莉
Dialogue: 1,1:34:30.47,1:34:36.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜上前帮助她 顺便化解了一下刚刚杰西到来后的尴尬氛围
Dialogue: 1,1:34:36.14,1:34:40.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜说她用无线电发现了追杀乔尔小队里的诺拉
Dialogue: 1,1:34:40.85,1:34:45.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在就在医院里 她可能知道埃比在哪
Dialogue: 1,1:34:45.89,1:34:48.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉立刻出发前往医院
Dialogue: 1,1:34:48.98,1:34:51.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这其实是游戏里非常安静的一章
Dialogue: 1,1:34:51.23,1:34:53.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为显然 艾莉是独自行动
Dialogue: 1,1:34:53.45,1:34:57.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,没人会来帮她 只能靠她自己
Dialogue: 1,1:34:57.32,1:35:01.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,而制作组也利用这个机会给玩家设了好多措手不及的局
Dialogue: 1,1:35:01.13,1:35:04.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,我非常非常喜欢这点
Dialogue: 1,1:35:04.01,1:35:07.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,最好的例子就是艾莉在工作台这里
Dialogue: 1,1:35:07.40,1:35:10.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏中工作台是用来升级武器的
Dialogue: 1,1:35:10.31,1:35:14.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,用你满世界搜刮来的零件资源给你的武器升级
Dialogue: 1,1:35:14.42,1:35:16.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,而就在这时惊喜来了
Dialogue: 1,1:35:35.69,1:35:39.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,我第一次玩的时候感觉这段太牛逼了
Dialogue: 1,1:35:39.32,1:35:43.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,我当时就……我靠！在菜单里也能被偷袭吗！
Dialogue: 1,1:35:43.91,1:35:47.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,我……我理解可能有些人会被吓到 甚至有些生气
Dialogue: 1,1:35:47.75,1:35:52.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为一般来讲在游戏的菜单界面肯定是绝对安全的
Dialogue: 1,1:35:52.91,1:35:56.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这个例子打破了这个惯例 我觉得太棒了
Dialogue: 1,1:35:56.27,1:35:59.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们现在也来顺便聊聊游戏的制造系统
Dialogue: 1,1:35:59.36,1:36:02.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,这代的制造系统和第一作非常像
Dialogue: 1,1:36:02.15,1:36:04.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是多了几项武器 比如爆破筒
Dialogue: 1,1:36:04.61,1:36:09.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,多数的角色升级选项一般只能点满一半的“技能树”
Dialogue: 1,1:36:09.15,1:36:11.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多游戏都这么叫 我就也这样说了
Dialogue: 1,1:36:11.63,1:36:15.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,二周目玩完两人各自那一半内容的话能点满艾莉和埃比的技能
Dialogue: 1,1:36:15.26,1:36:18.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,二周目玩完两人各自那一半内容的话能点满艾莉和埃比的技能
Dialogue: 1,1:36:18.86,1:36:21.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,点满以后感觉自己都无敌了
Dialogue: 1,1:36:21.03,1:36:26.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,在高难度下 这些制作素材真的少得可怜
Dialogue: 1,1:36:26.00,1:36:32.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们非常难找 一般也不会在游戏世界里自动刷新出来
Dialogue: 1,1:36:32.26,1:36:35.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,除非你在游戏里真的走投无路了
Dialogue: 1,1:36:35.30,1:36:41.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,但顽皮狗在TLOU系列游戏里的动态难度调整得真的很不错
Dialogue: 1,1:36:41.02,1:36:44.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,这方面的抱怨其实不多 除了治疗系统
Dialogue: 1,1:36:44.63,1:36:51.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏中各种快速回血的零食小吃在高难度下实在太多了
Dialogue: 1,1:36:51.29,1:36:54.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少我认为如此 这让游戏变得太简单
Dialogue: 1,1:36:54.38,1:36:59.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使对于例如生还者难度来说也是这样
Dialogue: 1,1:36:59.59,1:37:04.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里一部分原因我觉得是燃烧瓶和医疗包的制作材料相同
Dialogue: 1,1:37:04.63,1:37:07.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以实际上玩家经常会面对二选一的局面
Dialogue: 1,1:37:07.21,1:37:10.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,做医疗包还是做燃烧瓶
Dialogue: 1,1:37:10.95,1:37:15.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,看上去很蠢但我觉得其实很重要
Dialogue: 1,1:37:15.52,1:37:20.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为医疗包的使用只能说明玩家操控出现了重大失误
Dialogue: 1,1:37:20.54,1:37:24.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果在高难度下犯下重大失误 那基本就是个死
Dialogue: 1,1:37:24.71,1:37:26.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,继续玩也不值得
Dialogue: 1,1:37:26.62,1:37:30.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家通常会选择读取存档重新战斗
Dialogue: 1,1:37:30.53,1:37:33.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样在失误之前的所有弹药补给都还在
Dialogue: 1,1:37:33.74,1:37:36.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味着在我二周目的生还者难度游戏中
Dialogue: 1,1:37:36.53,1:37:42.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,我几乎从来没造过医疗包 因为燃烧瓶太有用了
Dialogue: 1,1:37:42.53,1:37:46.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,而如果我真到了生命值非常非常低的地步
Dialogue: 1,1:37:46.40,1:37:49.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我就干脆读取最近的存档
Dialogue: 1,1:37:49.16,1:37:53.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,尽量不要犯之前的、让我血量如此之低的错误
Dialogue: 1,1:37:53.12,1:37:57.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,关于搜刮制作机制我想讲的另一点是
Dialogue: 1,1:37:57.17,1:38:01.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,搜刮材料的过程的确会让你感觉在探索整个关卡
Dialogue: 1,1:38:01.04,1:38:05.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,在大多数情况下它可以鼓励玩家探索关卡各处
Dialogue: 1,1:38:05.45,1:38:10.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,但开发者使用了一个动态平衡生成的系统来实现这个内容
Dialogue: 1,1:38:10.75,1:38:14.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如如果你在为某个Boss战做准备
Dialogue: 1,1:38:14.99,1:38:18.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你就会发现大战之前必有补给
Dialogue: 1,1:38:18.43,1:38:23.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏会让你的装备达到Boss战所需的推荐水平
Dialogue: 1,1:38:23.90,1:38:26.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 没人逼着你捡这些东西
Dialogue: 1,1:38:26.45,1:38:31.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果你真的需要这些补给 那游戏就会越来越频繁地给你生成这些东西
Dialogue: 1,1:38:31.49,1:38:34.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果你真的需要这些补给 那游戏就会越来越频繁地给你生成这些东西
Dialogue: 1,1:38:34.22,1:38:38.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果是高难度 就会生成少一点
Dialogue: 1,1:38:38.09,1:38:41.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 游戏会计算出你需要这些东西
Dialogue: 1,1:38:41.51,1:38:45.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这意味着其实你不用非得到处探索来搜刮材料
Dialogue: 1,1:38:45.65,1:38:47.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,你直奔目的地都可以
Dialogue: 1,1:38:47.84,1:38:52.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,此时在你前往下一个区域之前游戏会有一个软件上的判定
Dialogue: 1,1:38:52.28,1:38:57.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这样的区域里游戏会给你自动生成某些补给品
Dialogue: 1,1:38:57.89,1:39:00.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,以供你继续前行使用
Dialogue: 1,1:39:00.92,1:39:03.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,说实话 我觉得这不是什么大问题
Dialogue: 1,1:39:03.50,1:39:06.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,真要说的话 其实这就是给速通玩家留的后门
Dialogue: 1,1:39:06.07,1:39:09.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我认为这种机制是利大于弊的
Dialogue: 1,1:39:09.64,1:39:14.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为如果有玩家错过了某个有大量补给的区域
Dialogue: 1,1:39:14.18,1:39:16.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个机制也不会让他们在之后的关卡中束手无策
Dialogue: 1,1:39:16.88,1:39:19.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,而游戏在这段突发惊吓后继续进行
Dialogue: 1,1:39:19.80,1:39:22.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉干掉了几个赛拉菲特帮 或者叫疤脸帮的人
Dialogue: 1,1:39:22.64,1:39:25.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,解决了几个谜题 干掉了几个感染者
Dialogue: 1,1:39:25.37,1:39:27.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,包括一些以潜行为主的感染者
Dialogue: 1,1:39:27.47,1:39:31.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果不是它们太他妈蠢了游戏应该能更有意思一点
Dialogue: 1,1:39:31.55,1:39:37.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这一章节的高潮点在于我们第一次直面赛拉菲特帮
Dialogue: 1,1:39:37.00,1:39:40.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们的战斗模式完全不同 他们更懂得潜行 战斗更加谨慎
Dialogue: 1,1:39:40.97,1:39:43.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,战斗的时候还会用口哨交流
Dialogue: 1,1:39:43.04,1:39:47.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,基于玩家的音响系统适当调节一下音频设置的话 真的会有奇效
Dialogue: 1,1:39:47.70,1:39:52.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,说真的 你完全不需要使用聆听模式就能知道敌人在哪里
Dialogue: 1,1:39:52.85,1:39:57.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以如果你有一副不错的耳机 或者家庭影院音响 玩着就非常爽了
Dialogue: 1,1:39:57.92,1:40:02.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,而据我所知 在下一代主机上这类技术会更多
Dialogue: 1,1:40:02.57,1:40:06.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如他们在搞的PS5上的3D音频之类的
Dialogue: 1,1:40:06.44,1:40:08.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的老牛逼了 我好期待
Dialogue: 1,1:40:08.58,1:40:13.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来是证明顽皮狗注重细节的一个有趣的地方
Dialogue: 1,1:40:13.46,1:40:15.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们来到有一群赛拉菲特帮的地方
Dialogue: 1,1:40:15.92,1:40:21.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果我们一开始在邪教成员把那个人开膛破肚之前炸死他们
Dialogue: 1,1:40:21.11,1:40:22.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,就会出现备用动画
Dialogue: 1,1:40:22.78,1:40:27.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 这只能发生在你玩到这里时解锁了爆炸箭
Dialogue: 1,1:40:27.20,1:40:28.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且刚好手里有一发的时候
Dialogue: 1,1:40:28.99,1:40:31.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果是一周目游戏 那这个过程还是挺漫长的
Dialogue: 1,1:40:31.98,1:40:34.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这更像是二周目游戏才能发现的事情
Dialogue: 1,1:40:34.64,1:40:38.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你解锁了爆炸箭然后炸死了所有的
Dialogue: 1,1:40:38.79,1:40:43.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,围在这个被吊起来的人周围想要给他开膛破肚的邪教成员
Dialogue: 1,1:40:43.88,1:40:49.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,那他会被一直吊在那 慢慢痛苦地死去
Dialogue: 1,1:40:49.10,1:40:51.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,除非你去帮忙送他一程
Dialogue: 1,1:40:51.26,1:40:52.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,我还真试过这个
Dialogue: 1,1:40:52.31,1:40:55.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,看能不能射绳子 把他放走
Dialogue: 1,1:40:55.64,1:40:57.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果发现做不到
Dialogue: 1,1:40:57.08,1:41:00.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能能做到但我瞄准太烂了打不到绳子
Dialogue: 1,1:41:00.53,1:41:05.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 游戏设计了两种情况的确很酷
Dialogue: 1,1:41:05.38,1:41:09.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,一种是邪教组织完成他们的小仪式
Dialogue: 1,1:41:09.32,1:41:13.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,一边吊死他一边给他开膛破肚
Dialogue: 1,1:41:13.70,1:41:18.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一种是你在邪教成员给他开膛破肚之前就杀死了邪教成员
Dialogue: 1,1:41:18.23,1:41:22.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,那他们就会把桶踢到一边 让那个人被活活吊死
Dialogue: 1,1:41:22.40,1:41:28.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,接着玩家或杀穿或潜行过多个赛拉菲特的地盘 最后遇到一个小型boss
Dialogue: 1,1:41:28.76,1:41:34.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,名叫赛拉菲特野蛮人 和艾莉蒂娜接吻预告片里看到的那个一样
Dialogue: 1,1:41:34.31,1:41:38.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人认为在这个最终版本里游戏打磨的不是那么完美
Dialogue: 1,1:41:38.99,1:41:41.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,少了些许流畅 但仍然很棒
Dialogue: 1,1:41:41.99,1:41:47.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,我这样说是因为这里脚本化的内容与动画看起来太少了
Dialogue: 1,1:41:47.00,1:41:50.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,但说实话 毕竟都看过预告 也无所谓了
Dialogue: 1,1:41:50.09,1:41:52.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,这场战斗在里屋还会出来几个杂兵
Dialogue: 1,1:41:52.88,1:41:56.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,让战斗在二周目下变得很难
Dialogue: 1,1:41:56.26,1:42:00.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为等我来到这里的时候 基本已经把弹药用光了
Dialogue: 1,1:42:00.65,1:42:04.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,让我只能几乎全程近战和他硬刚
Dialogue: 1,1:42:04.10,1:42:10.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是TLOU令人诟病的一点 游戏需要大量的试错
Dialogue: 1,1:42:10.97,1:42:15.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多时候打通某个场景的唯一办法
Dialogue: 1,1:42:15.64,1:42:18.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是不停地死 不停地重试
Dialogue: 1,1:42:18.65,1:42:21.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,最惨的例子就是现在这个场景
Dialogue: 1,1:42:21.36,1:42:23.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,我得想办法绕到里屋
Dialogue: 1,1:42:23.69,1:42:28.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,先杀里面的人 然后出来和之前里屋出来的野蛮人近战肉搏
Dialogue: 1,1:42:28.52,1:42:31.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,打死外屋的野蛮人后再回到里屋去
Dialogue: 1,1:42:31.70,1:42:35.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,需要非常多的试错才能找到最合适的方法
Dialogue: 1,1:42:35.09,1:42:38.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一个例子就是稍后艾莉在洪水泛滥的购物中心中找船的那段
Dialogue: 1,1:42:38.40,1:42:41.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一个例子就是稍后艾莉在洪水泛滥的购物中心中找船的那段
Dialogue: 1,1:42:41.90,1:42:44.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,视觉上那段场景真的非常棒
Dialogue: 1,1:42:44.63,1:42:49.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在生还者难度下我大概花了30分钟才找到一条刚好能避开所有人视线的路径
Dialogue: 1,1:42:49.61,1:42:52.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在生还者难度下我大概花了30分钟才找到一条刚好能避开所有人视线的路径
Dialogue: 1,1:42:52.94,1:42:55.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且即使爬到船上我也无法相信自己能逃掉
Dialogue: 1,1:42:55.84,1:43:01.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我一上船 启动发动机 所有敌人就发现了我 开始向我射击
Dialogue: 1,1:43:01.55,1:43:04.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,刹那间无数子弹向艾莉袭来
Dialogue: 1,1:43:04.94,1:43:08.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,本来死定了 但游戏还是让她把船开走了
Dialogue: 1,1:43:08.74,1:43:12.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,我能看出顽皮狗在你上船后削弱了敌人的瞄准
Dialogue: 1,1:43:12.88,1:43:15.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,给你营造一种在枪林弹雨中七进七出的感觉
Dialogue: 1,1:43:15.62,1:43:18.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我最开始玩的时候还竟然忘记了游戏开船的设定
Dialogue: 1,1:43:18.83,1:43:22.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,默认竟然是最最最蠢的布局
Dialogue: 1,1:43:22.37,1:43:25.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,我坐船上像傻子一样按着R2键
Dialogue: 1,1:43:25.35,1:43:29.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果发现船的移动竟然要完全使用左摇杆
Dialogue: 1,1:43:29.42,1:43:31.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,等我反应过来的时候
Dialogue: 1,1:43:31.37,1:43:34.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我可能早就凉透了 但我还是活下来了
Dialogue: 1,1:43:34.34,1:43:37.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,在那场小Boss战后 艾莉推进到了医院内
Dialogue: 1,1:43:37.97,1:43:40.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们一路潜行进入医院
Dialogue: 1,1:43:40.04,1:43:45.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们杀死了这个拿着PSV摸鱼的女孩 稍后在埃比的章节里还会见到她
Dialogue: 1,1:43:45.92,1:43:49.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,但也不用怕 她反正只出现了几秒
Dialogue: 1,1:43:49.13,1:43:52.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我们发现WLF正在清理整座医院 这也很合理
Dialogue: 1,1:43:52.91,1:43:54.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们要确保医院里没有感染者
Dialogue: 1,1:43:54.80,1:43:59.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们还在把所有的补给品送往总部
Dialogue: 1,1:43:59.69,1:44:02.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,个中缘由并没有解释
Dialogue: 1,1:44:02.21,1:44:06.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,稍后到了埃比篇就知道了
Dialogue: 1,1:44:06.29,1:44:09.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,就目前来说 我们知道WLF的头目 伊萨克
Dialogue: 1,1:44:09.65,1:44:14.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,下令把所有的物资运回总部所在地
Dialogue: 1,1:44:14.36,1:44:15.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们又打过几段场景
Dialogue: 1,1:44:15.88,1:44:19.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,你还是可以选择杀穿 也可以选择潜行通过这帮WLF士兵
Dialogue: 1,1:44:19.34,1:44:23.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,没什么重要内容 和之前一样
Dialogue: 1,1:44:23.09,1:44:26.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,而最终我们来到顶层 发现了诺拉
Dialogue: 1,1:44:26.96,1:44:29.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,她正在和其它WLF士兵谈论埃比的事
Dialogue: 1,1:44:29.69,1:44:32.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然埃比不见了 这些WLF士兵认为
Dialogue: 1,1:44:32.47,1:44:37.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,诺拉知道埃比的去处 也知道她是怎么跑掉的
Dialogue: 1,1:44:37.22,1:44:40.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,这令艾莉有些疑惑 因为据艾莉所知
Dialogue: 1,1:44:40.07,1:44:42.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比是WLF的负责人之一
Dialogue: 1,1:44:42.68,1:44:45.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,为什么她会被一些同伴追捕呢？
Dialogue: 1,1:44:45.71,1:44:47.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,她为什么会被关起来？
Dialogue: 1,1:44:47.21,1:44:52.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,为什么如果事实证明她知道埃比的下落就会有麻烦？
Dialogue: 1,1:44:52.97,1:44:55.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,这很令人困惑 但稍后会解释清
Dialogue: 1,1:44:55.76,1:44:57.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在对于玩家来说
Dialogue: 1,1:44:57.02,1:45:01.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来应该是埃比与WLF组织起了某种冲突
Dialogue: 1,1:45:01.04,1:45:02.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,有那么一瞬间
Dialogue: 1,1:45:02.03,1:45:06.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我曾想或许我们之后会和WLF联手去追捕埃比
Dialogue: 1,1:45:06.92,1:45:09.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟 敌人的敌人就是朋友
Dialogue: 1,1:45:09.92,1:45:12.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,可拉倒吧 别做梦了
Dialogue: 1,1:45:12.26,1:45:13.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,你在医院里一路追着诺拉
Dialogue: 1,1:45:13.79,1:45:17.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,在那之前两人有过简短的互动 其中诺拉这样问了艾莉：
Dialogue: 1,1:45:38.96,1:45:43.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,你把她追到了一个死胡同 走廊上有一个断口 下面是充满孢子的地下室
Dialogue: 1,1:45:43.79,1:45:45.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,全副武装的警卫也在追你
Dialogue: 1,1:45:45.71,1:45:48.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉挟持诺拉为人质 拿她当肉盾
Dialogue: 1,1:45:48.20,1:45:49.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,发现自己无路可逃
Dialogue: 1,1:45:49.91,1:45:53.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且诺拉知不知道自己的免疫能力已经不重要了
Dialogue: 1,1:45:53.15,1:45:56.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟她马上就要因为吸入孢子而死了
Dialogue: 1,1:45:56.45,1:45:58.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以艾莉就带着诺拉跳进了地下室
Dialogue: 1,1:45:58.31,1:46:02.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,干掉几个感染者后 在走廊一个死胡同处发现了蜷缩着的诺拉
Dialogue: 1,1:46:02.72,1:46:07.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后便是接下来 我们看到艾莉黑化的一幕
Dialogue: 1,1:48:02.33,1:48:05.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉全身沾着诺拉的血 回到了剧院
Dialogue: 1,1:48:05.15,1:48:08.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,她显然因自己刚刚为了获取埃比位置信息而做的一切感到痛苦
Dialogue: 1,1:48:08.93,1:48:10.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她还是做到了
Dialogue: 1,1:48:10.28,1:48:15.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,她知道埃比因为某种原因在水族馆
Dialogue: 1,1:48:15.05,1:48:16.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜帮艾莉清理干净
Dialogue: 1,1:48:16.85,1:48:22.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,正是在这里 我们第一次看到了这场复仇对艾莉造成的肉体上的影响
Dialogue: 1,1:48:22.40,1:48:26.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,从对话和行为中我们能看出艾莉精神上的痛苦
Dialogue: 1,1:48:26.09,1:48:28.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这在很大程度上仍有待解释
Dialogue: 1,1:48:28.61,1:48:32.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,而肉体上的伤害是大家有目共睹的
Dialogue: 1,1:48:32.93,1:48:34.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段场景简短而安静
Dialogue: 1,1:48:34.64,1:48:37.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,在感人的片段过后 艾莉和蒂娜睡觉了
Dialogue: 1,1:48:37.85,1:48:40.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,故事进入「西雅图 第3天」
Dialogue: 1,1:48:40.49,1:48:42.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,首先是一段两年前的回忆
Dialogue: 1,1:48:42.89,1:48:46.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉回到了一代作品中结尾部分的医院
Dialogue: 1,1:48:46.08,1:48:50.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,在探索了医院 发现了一些文书和最关键的录音记录后
Dialogue: 1,1:48:50.87,1:48:53.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,她发现了曾经这里的真相
Dialogue: 1,1:48:53.27,1:48:57.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔害怕永远失去艾莉 也终于不得不告诉她真相
Dialogue: 1,1:52:24.95,1:52:28.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,这标志着乔尔和艾莉关系的一个重要转折点
Dialogue: 1,1:52:28.37,1:52:31.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉很早就知道乔尔并没有那样诚实
Dialogue: 1,1:52:31.55,1:52:32.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,她心里有数
Dialogue: 1,1:52:32.90,1:52:35.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而即使她对乔尔有所怀疑
Dialogue: 1,1:52:35.15,1:52:39.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,也仍然是往的好方面去想的 以免破坏两人的关系
Dialogue: 1,1:52:39.50,1:52:44.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,但现在 真相大白于天下 艾莉感受到了背叛
Dialogue: 1,1:52:44.81,1:52:47.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,她所担忧的一切都是真的
Dialogue: 1,1:52:47.18,1:52:51.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许成功制作疫苗的几率并不高
Dialogue: 1,1:52:51.95,1:52:56.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是考虑到火萤组织在整个第一部作品中是多么的废物
Dialogue: 1,1:52:56.93,1:52:59.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,但重要的是艾莉得知真相后
Dialogue: 1,1:52:59.75,1:53:02.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,她便明白这个概率并不完全是零
Dialogue: 1,1:53:02.93,1:53:06.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 概率不高 但不是完全没有
Dialogue: 1,1:53:06.11,1:53:10.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,这给艾莉带来了巨大的负担 她觉得自己对人类有责任
Dialogue: 1,1:53:10.73,1:53:17.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,要献出自己的生命来挽救其他人 这样就有可能重建人类文明
Dialogue: 1,1:53:17.03,1:53:20.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一个有趣的问题 特别是当你把自己放在她的位置上时
Dialogue: 1,1:53:20.75,1:53:23.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你是艾莉你会怎样做？
Dialogue: 1,1:53:23.81,1:53:28.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你的性命关系到这一切的解药？
Dialogue: 1,1:53:28.67,1:53:33.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你能牺牲你自己 那这一切的苦难就有可能得到化解
Dialogue: 1,1:53:33.44,1:53:38.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,我用的是“可能”因为没人保证这真的会成功
Dialogue: 1,1:53:38.06,1:53:41.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,就算疫苗真的被研发出来了
Dialogue: 1,1:53:41.39,1:53:46.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,谁又能在整个地球上分发这种疫苗？
Dialogue: 1,1:53:46.07,1:53:51.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟TLOU2的背景是全世界的秩序已经彻底崩塌了
Dialogue: 1,1:53:51.62,1:53:55.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,人们会毫无理由地互相背叛
Dialogue: 1,1:53:55.61,1:54:00.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,信任在这个世界里早已不复存在
Dialogue: 1,1:54:00.05,1:54:03.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且毫无疑问 如果有人屁颠屁颠跑到你的据点前
Dialogue: 1,1:54:03.80,1:54:08.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,说自己有疫苗 有治愈虫草菌的办法
Dialogue: 1,1:54:08.15,1:54:13.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你首先会持高度怀疑的态度 根本不会让他进入你的据点
Dialogue: 1,1:54:13.13,1:54:18.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,关键是 我理解艾莉对乔尔擅自为她做决定而伤感
Dialogue: 1,1:54:18.26,1:54:21.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这个决定也是为了她好
Dialogue: 1,1:54:21.08,1:54:25.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而即使是这样也不能改变这样一个现实：
Dialogue: 1,1:54:25.28,1:54:29.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个决定不是治愈与不治愈那么简单
Dialogue: 1,1:54:29.40,1:54:33.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,也不是艾莉能不能拯救人类那么简单
Dialogue: 1,1:54:33.35,1:54:37.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,事情没那么简单 这个世界也不是非黑即白的
Dialogue: 1,1:54:37.70,1:54:42.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许总体分析TLOU2故事情节的时候
Dialogue: 1,1:54:42.38,1:54:50.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可以指着乔尔的行为说他为了拯救一个他非常关心的人而毁了全人类
Dialogue: 1,1:54:50.24,1:54:54.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而我认为凡事都有两面性 因为你完全可以说
Dialogue: 1,1:54:54.25,1:55:00.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使疫苗研发出来了 也不太可能分发出去
Dialogue: 1,1:55:00.59,1:55:04.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者只能用在一个很小的社区环境内
Dialogue: 1,1:55:04.37,1:55:08.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,但同时你还可以说如果确实如此的话
Dialogue: 1,1:55:08.25,1:55:13.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果疫苗只在火萤组织或者WLF内部使用
Dialogue: 1,1:55:13.20,1:55:17.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这些组织最后都分散到全国各地
Dialogue: 1,1:55:17.66,1:55:21.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你的确可以说艾莉的牺牲是值得的
Dialogue: 1,1:55:21.09,1:55:25.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为她能拯救几十条 甚至成百上千条生命
Dialogue: 1,1:55:25.64,1:55:30.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然不如几万几亿数量级那么多 但也是个很伟大的数字了
Dialogue: 1,1:55:30.17,1:55:34.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,更广泛的观点是 艾莉觉得这个决定是乔尔帮他做出的
Dialogue: 1,1:55:34.19,1:55:35.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为的确如此
Dialogue: 1,1:55:35.51,1:55:41.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且艾莉因为乔尔欺骗了她多年而感受到了来自乔尔的背叛
Dialogue: 1,1:55:41.84,1:55:45.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段闪回过后 镜头回到在剧院里醒来的艾莉
Dialogue: 1,1:55:45.29,1:55:47.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,她去看杰西和蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,1:55:47.66,1:55:50.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,简单谈论了蒂娜的身孕后
Dialogue: 1,1:55:50.36,1:55:53.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和杰西决定一起去水族馆
Dialogue: 1,1:55:53.84,1:55:56.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们认为艾莉很可能藏在那
Dialogue: 1,1:55:56.81,1:55:58.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不知道她为什么会在那
Dialogue: 1,1:55:58.67,1:56:04.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不知道为什么她会躲着、会害怕WLF
Dialogue: 1,1:56:04.82,1:56:08.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟她看上去应该是属于WLF组织的
Dialogue: 1,1:56:08.33,1:56:12.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以至少玩家会奇怪这里面到底发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,1:56:12.44,1:56:13.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我的一周目游戏过程中
Dialogue: 1,1:56:13.52,1:56:20.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,我以为是其他人因她擅离职守追杀乔尔这件事而想整她
Dialogue: 1,1:56:20.24,1:56:22.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这又不太合理
Dialogue: 1,1:56:22.43,1:56:26.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为和她一起去的其他人
Dialogue: 1,1:56:26.20,1:56:29.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,都还好好在做自己的日常工作
Dialogue: 1,1:56:29.42,1:56:30.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以在这最后一天
Dialogue: 1,1:56:30.95,1:56:35.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们所有的疑惑只剩下埃比逃离WLF的原因
Dialogue: 1,1:56:35.48,1:56:39.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及其他角色间听到的小传言
Dialogue: 1,1:56:39.23,1:56:42.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 艾莉和杰西一起向水族馆推进
Dialogue: 1,1:56:42.48,1:56:45.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这段游戏内容我感觉做得相当一般
Dialogue: 1,1:56:45.95,1:56:48.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里的战斗没那么有趣
Dialogue: 1,1:56:48.32,1:56:52.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,宏观上讲 这段只是为了让艾莉和杰西能够直面蒂娜怀孕的问题
Dialogue: 1,1:56:52.28,1:56:55.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,宏观上讲 这段只是为了让艾莉和杰西能够直面蒂娜怀孕的问题
Dialogue: 1,1:56:55.73,1:57:00.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,整段流程下来 他们认为必须让蒂娜回杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,1:57:00.50,1:57:01.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,没有其他办法
Dialogue: 1,1:57:01.60,1:57:07.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果她想安全把宝宝生下来
Dialogue: 1,1:57:07.37,1:57:10.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,她就必须从哪来回哪去
Dialogue: 1,1:57:10.07,1:57:13.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也意味着这很可能是他们最后一次寻找埃比的机会了
Dialogue: 1,1:57:13.73,1:57:15.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们一旦找到汤米
Dialogue: 1,1:57:15.53,1:57:18.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们就要收拾东西回杰克逊了
Dialogue: 1,1:57:18.50,1:57:24.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰西、蒂娜、尤其是汤米 很可能不会让艾莉留下来
Dialogue: 1,1:57:24.06,1:57:26.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰西知道孩子是自己的
Dialogue: 1,1:57:26.18,1:57:29.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 蒂娜自己还没告诉杰西自己怀孕的事情
Dialogue: 1,1:57:29.74,1:57:35.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,她一直想保守这个秘密 看着挺蠢的 也可能只有我这么觉得
Dialogue: 1,1:57:35.42,1:57:38.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 大家的动机全都变了
Dialogue: 1,1:57:38.27,1:57:43.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰西的重心不再是寻找埃比复仇了
Dialogue: 1,1:57:43.07,1:57:47.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,他现在更想赶紧找到汤米 然后大家一起回杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,1:57:47.15,1:57:49.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉嘴上也是这样说
Dialogue: 1,1:57:49.01,1:57:53.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而 她还是更想去找埃比 我们稍后就能看到她的具体表现
Dialogue: 1,1:57:53.87,1:57:59.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,当杰西和艾莉通过无线电得知码头上有一名狙击手时 整个事件达到了高潮
Dialogue: 1,1:57:59.18,1:58:03.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,这名狙击手干掉了一群WLF成员 带来了不少麻烦
Dialogue: 1,1:58:03.56,1:58:05.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰西和艾莉推断这人肯定是汤米
Dialogue: 1,1:58:05.93,1:58:10.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,这倒很合理 毕竟WLF不可能自己中门对狙玩
Dialogue: 1,1:58:10.85,1:58:16.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,而疤脸帮也不太会这样用狙击枪 所以不太可能是那边的人
Dialogue: 1,1:58:16.85,1:58:23.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这人要么是汤米 要么是碰巧为了好玩想和WLF对狙的个人势
Dialogue: 1,1:58:23.45,1:58:26.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然了 大家在这天结束发现他的确就是汤米
Dialogue: 1,1:58:26.51,1:58:30.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在这里我们看到艾莉做了一个很难解释的决定
Dialogue: 1,1:58:30.47,1:58:35.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉坚持说汤米自己不会有事的 不需要她帮忙
Dialogue: 1,1:58:35.48,1:58:39.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,话是这样说没错 但问题在于艾莉的想法
Dialogue: 1,1:58:39.32,1:58:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然 汤米能一路杀到这里
Dialogue: 1,1:58:41.30,1:58:43.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他单人和WLF的人对狙这件事
Dialogue: 1,1:58:43.96,1:58:48.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,也能看出他对他自己应付这么多人的能力还是有信心的
Dialogue: 1,1:58:48.32,1:58:54.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,但艾莉这样说不是因为她顾及杰西、蒂娜或者她自己的安危
Dialogue: 1,1:58:54.85,1:59:00.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是明显想要自己赶快找到埃比 杀掉她复仇
Dialogue: 1,1:59:00.08,1:59:04.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,完成她自己想做的一切后 才能和汤米、杰西与蒂娜一起回杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,1:59:04.58,1:59:07.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,完成她自己想做的一切后 才能和汤米、杰西与蒂娜一起回杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,1:59:07.16,1:59:08.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道你们怎样想
Dialogue: 1,1:59:08.45,1:59:09.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,我第一次玩到这里时
Dialogue: 1,1:59:09.98,1:59:14.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,我立刻失去了对艾莉所有的同情心
Dialogue: 1,1:59:14.81,1:59:19.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,在此时 她做出了一个在我看来错误的决定
Dialogue: 1,1:59:19.28,1:59:27.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,她有可能为了一己私欲而伤害到所有她爱着的人
Dialogue: 1,1:59:27.77,1:59:31.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点在主题上类似于乔尔在第一部作品中的行为
Dialogue: 1,1:59:31.34,1:59:35.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,他为了自己不失去艾莉而放弃了全人类的命运
Dialogue: 1,1:59:35.84,1:59:40.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是整个游戏中制作者做了好多次的事情
Dialogue: 1,1:59:40.55,1:59:47.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏流程中有很多平行的场景 旨在呼应之前发生的事情
Dialogue: 1,1:59:47.48,1:59:48.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,例子不胜枚举
Dialogue: 1,1:59:48.71,1:59:52.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用说也知道杰西对艾莉的决定很不满
Dialogue: 1,1:59:52.70,1:59:55.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家也很可能对她不满
Dialogue: 1,1:59:55.55,1:59:58.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他决定自己去找汤米
Dialogue: 1,1:59:58.33,2:00:01.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,带汤米回剧院 这样大家之后就能一起离开西雅图
Dialogue: 1,2:00:01.55,2:00:03.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉独自行动
Dialogue: 1,2:00:03.50,2:00:06.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,她为一艘她看到的驶过运河的船而进行了一番战斗
Dialogue: 1,2:00:06.80,2:00:09.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,希望能开船到港口对面的水族馆
Dialogue: 1,2:00:09.98,2:00:14.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段战斗真的非常有难度 尤其在高难度下
Dialogue: 1,2:00:14.51,2:00:18.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,几乎需要非常完美的潜入技巧
Dialogue: 1,2:00:18.35,2:00:22.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过幸运的是游戏设计者也知悉这点
Dialogue: 1,2:00:22.49,2:00:25.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以很多关卡都有一些秘密通道
Dialogue: 1,2:00:25.56,2:00:28.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,可以让你绕过很多敌人
Dialogue: 1,2:00:28.59,2:00:32.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样你完全可以一人不杀来到下一个检查点
Dialogue: 1,2:00:32.87,2:00:35.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者只杀特定的几个
Dialogue: 1,2:00:35.78,2:00:40.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 这是整个游戏中关卡设计的典范
Dialogue: 1,2:00:40.64,2:00:46.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,让潜行机制充分发光发热 这点TLOU2做的非常棒
Dialogue: 1,2:00:46.22,2:00:48.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家继续向水族馆推进
Dialogue: 1,2:00:48.71,2:00:52.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,干掉了几波赛拉菲特帮的敌人
Dialogue: 1,2:00:52.10,2:00:55.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,解决了一个还是两个巨无霸 还解开了几个场景中的谜题
Dialogue: 1,2:00:55.76,2:00:58.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,不太难 但绕不开
Dialogue: 1,2:00:58.40,2:01:00.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后你终于来到港口这里
Dialogue: 1,2:01:00.72,2:01:04.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,向着水族馆旁边的海岸前进
Dialogue: 1,2:01:04.28,2:01:07.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,这时艾莉的船被一个巨浪拍碎 差点被淹死
Dialogue: 1,2:01:07.94,2:01:12.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,但最后还是勉强游到了水族馆外的岸边
Dialogue: 1,2:01:12.05,2:01:17.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想说这段游玩内容简直行云流水 做的太漂亮了
Dialogue: 1,2:01:17.57,2:01:19.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,我吹爆
Dialogue: 1,2:01:19.82,2:01:21.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,我自己并不是个游戏开发者
Dialogue: 1,2:01:21.56,2:01:28.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我深入研究过很多关卡设计和内存系统管理的复杂问题
Dialogue: 1,2:01:28.06,2:01:31.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,看看它们在整个游戏过程中扮演怎样的角色
Dialogue: 1,2:01:31.25,2:01:34.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这一关绝对是榨干了每一滴的性能
Dialogue: 1,2:01:34.43,2:01:38.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,我必须为顽皮狗所有开发人员的努力工作献上掌声
Dialogue: 1,2:01:38.42,2:01:43.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,回到正题上来 艾莉终于进入了水族馆 却发现了一些奇怪的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:01:43.52,2:01:45.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,有几个门是锁着的
Dialogue: 1,2:01:45.29,2:01:50.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,有一个房间的灯光亮着 手术台上散乱着血淋淋的器械
Dialogue: 1,2:01:50.32,2:01:52.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,以目前我们在游戏中掌握的情况来看
Dialogue: 1,2:01:52.64,2:01:57.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们认为这里一定是在进行一些奇怪的拷问 仅此而已
Dialogue: 1,2:01:57.83,2:02:02.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而 正如我们稍后看到的 这其实没有想的那么吓人
Dialogue: 1,2:02:02.69,2:02:06.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉爬进了一段通风管 然后发生了这样的事情——
Dialogue: 1,2:02:37.04,2:02:39.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,这条狗好像就是随便跑进来的一只
Dialogue: 1,2:02:39.71,2:02:44.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像预告片里你杀过的随便一只一样
Dialogue: 1,2:02:44.15,2:02:47.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,但别急 我们之后就会知道它的更多信息
Dialogue: 1,2:02:47.13,2:02:51.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉调整状态继续推进 却发现一扇大门后有人说话的声音
Dialogue: 1,2:02:51.59,2:02:54.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,她打开门 然后发生了这样的一幕
Dialogue: 1,2:06:03.59,2:06:07.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,无需多言 这是一个极其压抑的场景
Dialogue: 1,2:06:07.67,2:06:10.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,这件事我老早就预料到了
Dialogue: 1,2:06:10.61,2:06:13.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗的编剧们有一点我非常了解
Dialogue: 1,2:06:13.37,2:06:15.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其是尼尔·德鲁克曼和哈雷·格罗斯
Dialogue: 1,2:06:15.47,2:06:17.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们很喜欢运用类比
Dialogue: 1,2:06:17.83,2:06:20.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们喜欢人物之间的映射
Dialogue: 1,2:06:20.36,2:06:24.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,这让玩家有机会观察到两个不同的人在类似情况下的反应
Dialogue: 1,2:06:24.92,2:06:30.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此每当你开始看到相似的东西或角色有共同点的东西时
Dialogue: 1,2:06:30.20,2:06:32.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,你就可以假设开发者和编剧
Dialogue: 1,2:06:32.57,2:06:38.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,将迫使这两个角色进入某种可以明显看出来的类似状况
Dialogue: 1,2:06:38.18,2:06:42.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这个例子里 艾莉的女友蒂娜怀孕了
Dialogue: 1,2:06:42.29,2:06:46.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我们第一次见到欧文和埃比的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:06:46.83,2:06:48.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,梅尔也怀孕了
Dialogue: 1,2:06:48.87,2:06:51.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,在当时 站在雪天悬崖边鸟瞰杰克逊小镇的我们还不知道梅尔是谁
Dialogue: 1,2:06:51.83,2:06:55.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,在当时 站在雪天悬崖边鸟瞰杰克逊小镇的我们还不知道梅尔是谁
Dialogue: 1,2:06:55.49,2:07:02.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我当时个人就猜想 艾利最后很有可能杀死了怀孕的梅尔
Dialogue: 1,2:07:02.28,2:07:05.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,单纯因为蒂娜很有可能最后也会怀孕
Dialogue: 1,2:07:05.78,2:07:08.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,事实也的确如此 当蒂娜说自己怀孕了以后
Dialogue: 1,2:07:08.69,2:07:10.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,我基本就确信我的猜想了
Dialogue: 1,2:07:10.47,2:07:15.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在除了这个情节的可预测性外 我还要问另一个问题
Dialogue: 1,2:07:15.02,2:07:20.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就是如果欧文和梅尔出卖了埃比 艾莉是否真的会杀死他们
Dialogue: 1,2:07:20.93,2:07:24.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,考虑到我们在这个游戏中对艾莉的了解
Dialogue: 1,2:07:24.53,2:07:27.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为她很有可能会这样做
Dialogue: 1,2:07:27.60,2:07:31.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,听起来很可怕 但艾莉就是为了复仇而来的
Dialogue: 1,2:07:31.70,2:07:36.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些仇人就站在面前 尽管某种角度上讲她其实欠欧文一条命
Dialogue: 1,2:07:36.36,2:07:40.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,当艾莉趴在地上盯着乔尔的尸体 其他人都想杀了她以绝后患的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:07:40.61,2:07:44.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,欧文就是那个插手的人
Dialogue: 1,2:07:44.06,2:07:46.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且客观地讲 当时杀了艾莉才是更理智的做法
Dialogue: 1,2:07:46.97,2:07:49.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是考虑到TLOU2的世界观
Dialogue: 1,2:07:49.91,2:07:53.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之 她的确欠欧文一条命
Dialogue: 1,2:07:53.69,2:07:56.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,可即便如此 我还是觉得她会杀了欧文
Dialogue: 1,2:07:56.15,2:08:00.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一个问题是 埃比在哪里 她怎么了
Dialogue: 1,2:08:00.14,2:08:01.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,她去哪了？
Dialogue: 1,2:08:01.22,2:08:04.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,还要多久她才会发现艾莉的所作所为呢？
Dialogue: 1,2:08:04.91,2:08:07.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,她当初为什么要离开？
Dialogue: 1,2:08:07.19,2:08:09.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,看上去她像是在躲着艾莉
Dialogue: 1,2:08:09.77,2:08:12.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这真说不太通
Dialogue: 1,2:08:12.62,2:08:16.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟她好像从一开始就在躲着什么
Dialogue: 1,2:08:16.82,2:08:22.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来她因为某事情而不得不暂时离开自己在WLF的职位
Dialogue: 1,2:08:22.25,2:08:24.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这让伊萨克对她很不满
Dialogue: 1,2:08:24.44,2:08:28.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之 我觉得顽皮狗在让故事顺其自然地发展
Dialogue: 1,2:08:28.28,2:08:33.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家不用想太多 坐着看之后更多的剧情内容就好
Dialogue: 1,2:08:33.08,2:08:34.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,而实际上我觉得这样是OK的
Dialogue: 1,2:08:34.67,2:08:38.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是因为艾莉无论是对埃比为何去别的地方的原因
Dialogue: 1,2:08:38.48,2:08:42.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是因为艾莉无论是对埃比为何去别的地方的原因
Dialogue: 1,2:08:42.04,2:08:45.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是对埃比和其它成员不和的原因都不是特别感兴趣
Dialogue: 1,2:08:45.53,2:08:47.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,她现在只对复仇感兴趣
Dialogue: 1,2:08:47.96,2:08:50.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,关于这段情节的最后一部分 让我不禁觉得
Dialogue: 1,2:08:50.97,2:08:57.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米、杰西和艾莉就这样一走了之好像有点奇怪
Dialogue: 1,2:08:57.11,2:09:01.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们看见了地上的尸体 却选择了转身离去
Dialogue: 1,2:09:01.64,2:09:04.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,竟然还押韵了 我不是故意的
Dialogue: 1,2:09:04.19,2:09:06.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,抱歉……呃……我们继续说
Dialogue: 1,2:09:06.74,2:09:08.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,我倒不是要求他们精心处理好水族馆的现场 清理所有的尸体
Dialogue: 1,2:09:08.83,2:09:12.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,我倒不是要求他们精心处理好水族馆的现场 清理所有的尸体
Dialogue: 1,2:09:12.50,2:09:16.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,保证埃比没藏在水族馆的什么地方
Dialogue: 1,2:09:16.04,2:09:17.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,但至少
Dialogue: 1,2:09:17.84,2:09:22.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们没有对整个建筑的其他部分进行更细致的检查 这好像有点奇怪
Dialogue: 1,2:09:22.07,2:09:27.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们只是找到了艾莉 显然她对自己刚刚做的事情感到非常震惊
Dialogue: 1,2:09:27.62,2:09:29.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们直接就走了
Dialogue: 1,2:09:29.36,2:09:33.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许在这时 他们已经接受了他们不可能找到埃比的事实
Dialogue: 1,2:09:33.29,2:09:35.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,命运就这样了
Dialogue: 1,2:09:35.12,2:09:37.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且他们已经造成了足够的伤害 已经表明了自己的观点
Dialogue: 1,2:09:37.93,2:09:43.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,不管怎么说 这之后的场面其实很平静 相当令人清爽
Dialogue: 1,2:09:43.55,2:09:46.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们看到艾莉和蒂娜在床上 只是在休息
Dialogue: 1,2:09:46.92,2:09:50.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,过了一会儿 艾莉去和杰西和汤米谈话
Dialogue: 1,2:09:50.21,2:09:52.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,试图确定返回杰克逊小镇的最佳路线
Dialogue: 1,2:09:52.97,2:09:56.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们已经正式决定不再继续找埃比了
Dialogue: 1,2:09:56.21,2:10:00.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是要为了蒂娜未出生的孩子 把她送到安全的地方
Dialogue: 1,2:10:00.44,2:10:03.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,一切都很正常 直到……
Dialogue: 1,2:11:12.26,2:11:16.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一个极其突然且尖锐的叙事转折
Dialogue: 1,2:11:16.34,2:11:20.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,我知道要发生一些事情了 但我没想到会如此突然
Dialogue: 1,2:11:20.61,2:11:25.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰西的死几乎是这段剪辑一开始就发生的
Dialogue: 1,2:11:25.91,2:11:31.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,没有任何警示 没有任何预想 就这样发生了 杰西死了
Dialogue: 1,2:11:31.76,2:11:36.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里还有个问题是这他妈……这……这什么玩意？
Dialogue: 1,2:11:36.20,2:11:39.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,这……也太辣眼睛了 好好 跑题了跑题了
Dialogue: 1,2:11:39.74,2:11:42.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我知道这段场景很严肃很悲伤
Dialogue: 1,2:11:42.41,2:11:46.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这画面几乎彻底把气氛毁没了 因为我第一次玩到这里的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:11:46.67,2:11:49.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉的胳膊上缠着绷带
Dialogue: 1,2:11:49.31,2:11:51.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这里其实不应该有的
Dialogue: 1,2:11:51.32,2:11:54.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是来自之前的场景里用的医疗包
Dialogue: 1,2:11:54.56,2:12:01.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,但不知道怎么回事 她胳膊的模型网格出问题了
Dialogue: 1,2:12:01.13,2:12:06.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来像得了软骨病一样
Dialogue: 1,2:12:06.62,2:12:11.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,看着很奇怪 但我本来不想抱怨这事的
Dialogue: 1,2:12:11.87,2:12:16.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,可之后我玩二周目游戏的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:12:16.29,2:12:19.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,却没发生这样的事情 她的胳膊又正常了
Dialogue: 1,2:12:19.04,2:12:21.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我感觉这应该是游戏bug
Dialogue: 1,2:12:21.02,2:12:26.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,这只是一个非常奇怪的问题 我真的不知道该怎么解释
Dialogue: 1,2:12:26.15,2:12:28.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之它还是发生了
Dialogue: 1,2:12:28.16,2:12:33.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,我以后做噩梦都会看见艾莉长了个霸王龙一样的小手
Dialogue: 1,2:12:33.14,2:12:36.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,唉 没救了 希望你们没遇到过这样的bug
Dialogue: 1,2:12:36.62,2:12:42.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对我个人来说 整段剧情基本都因为我一直对着那条细胳膊傻笑而毁没了
Dialogue: 1,2:12:42.53,2:12:44.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们懂的……就这样吧
Dialogue: 1,2:12:44.86,2:12:48.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,到了这里 游戏的前半部分就算结束了
Dialogue: 1,2:12:48.24,2:12:50.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,别急 我之后会讨论玩到游戏中期的想法
Dialogue: 1,2:12:50.97,2:12:56.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及我游玩过程中的心路历程 情绪等各种内容
Dialogue: 1,2:12:56.06,2:12:58.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,但首先我想先过一遍接下来的场景
Dialogue: 1,2:12:58.11,2:13:05.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,在埃比枪杀杰西 貌似杀死了汤米 同时拿枪指着艾莉的镜头之后
Dialogue: 1,2:13:05.66,2:13:11.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们直接跳转到了一个年轻 还没有那么多肌肉的埃比
Dialogue: 1,2:13:11.09,2:13:15.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,她在找她爸爸 而她爸爸在找某只动物
Dialogue: 1,2:13:15.47,2:13:18.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,后来发现是一只产仔过后的斑马
Dialogue: 1,2:13:18.77,2:13:24.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段很温暖 给我们过去十小时游戏经历的悲痛带来了些许慰藉
Dialogue: 1,2:13:24.06,2:13:29.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,说真的 我之前都没意识到TLOU2的前半部分玩着有多么艰难
Dialogue: 1,2:13:29.93,2:13:34.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,直到我玩到这个场景 感觉就像是从第一代结尾直接跳到这里一样
Dialogue: 1,2:13:34.73,2:13:42.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少对我而言 我感觉艾莉在这作是一个非常难相处的人
Dialogue: 1,2:13:42.03,2:13:48.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,在第一部作品中 她身上有一些能引起所有人共鸣的人性特点
Dialogue: 1,2:13:48.44,2:13:53.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家能与乔尔和艾莉以某种难以名状而遥不可及的方式产生情感共鸣
Dialogue: 1,2:13:53.45,2:13:57.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而这在第二部作品中表现却寥寥无几
Dialogue: 1,2:13:57.89,2:14:02.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,这让我实在喜欢不起来续作中的艾莉
Dialogue: 1,2:14:02.21,2:14:07.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以游戏前半部分操控艾莉的时候总有种奇怪的感觉
Dialogue: 1,2:14:07.85,2:14:12.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,你不会太喜欢她 也无法饶恕她做出的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:14:12.59,2:14:24.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后剧情到了你操控的埃比杀死了你开始尊敬 喜爱甚至爱上了的角色
Dialogue: 1,2:14:24.92,2:14:31.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,但你发现自己开始慢慢了解埃比 对她性格的喜欢甚至超过了艾莉
Dialogue: 1,2:14:31.19,2:14:35.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种体验很非同寻常 我认为其中有一半是制作者刻意为之的
Dialogue: 1,2:14:35.66,2:14:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,也就是说我认为这段埃比好相处与惹人喜欢的品质是刻意安排的
Dialogue: 1,2:14:41.30,2:14:46.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,而前半部分艾莉让人喜欢不起来的感受则不完全是刻意安排的
Dialogue: 1,2:14:46.40,2:14:52.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 在这个时间点我觉得绝大多数玩家是非常憎恨埃比的
Dialogue: 1,2:14:52.04,2:14:53.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不怪大家
Dialogue: 1,2:14:53.51,2:14:58.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟她杀死了游戏史上最让玩家喜爱的角色乔尔
Dialogue: 1,2:14:58.46,2:15:03.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也理解游戏强迫你操控埃比所带来的厌恶感
Dialogue: 1,2:15:03.20,2:15:05.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而 游戏制作者希望你能给埃比一个机会
Dialogue: 1,2:15:05.57,2:15:10.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,也正因如此 他们把时间调回了四年前
Dialogue: 1,2:15:10.40,2:15:11.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,我之前提到过
Dialogue: 1,2:15:11.69,2:15:16.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,我曾做过一次调查 统计大家对这个游戏的看法
Dialogue: 1,2:15:16.82,2:15:20.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论这个游戏是否达到了你的期待 都可以畅所欲言
Dialogue: 1,2:15:20.51,2:15:22.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果没有达到 那怎样改会更好
Dialogue: 1,2:15:22.73,2:15:26.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,调查中有几十个问题
Dialogue: 1,2:15:26.69,2:15:31.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不会在这一一列举这些问题 不过我已经整理好了一个Excel表格
Dialogue: 1,2:15:31.28,2:15:35.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家可以随意筛选各种问题的答案
Dialogue: 1,2:15:35.66,2:15:38.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这当中其实有很多有趣的信息
Dialogue: 1,2:15:38.24,2:15:41.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,我花了大约一周筛选了大量的回复
Dialogue: 1,2:15:41.81,2:15:44.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为其中有很多宝贵的留言
Dialogue: 1,2:15:44.66,2:15:46.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,但其中令我震惊的一点是
Dialogue: 1,2:15:46.99,2:15:51.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人在游戏玩到这就弃坑了
Dialogue: 1,2:15:51.26,2:15:55.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们完成了游戏前半部分 大部分时间都很享受艾莉的章节
Dialogue: 1,2:15:55.55,2:15:59.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,但当他们看到自己要被迫操控埃比的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:15:59.03,2:16:02.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们就觉得受到了背叛 放弃游戏了
Dialogue: 1,2:16:02.36,2:16:07.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,我本来想直接放一些玩家们表达的这种挫折感的评论
Dialogue: 1,2:16:07.46,2:16:13.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,但奈何其中一些人的言语实在难登大雅之堂
Dialogue: 1,2:16:13.70,2:16:16.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,要是放出来的话我这频道收益化就拜拜了
Dialogue: 1,2:16:16.46,2:16:19.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我打算简单转述一下他们的意思
Dialogue: 1,2:16:19.13,2:16:23.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你想看实际评论内容的话
Dialogue: 1,2:16:23.27,2:16:27.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,视频下方会有整个调查结果的链接
Dialogue: 1,2:16:27.56,2:16:31.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,总的来说 在这个时间点放弃游戏的玩家认为
Dialogue: 1,2:16:31.60,2:16:36.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们被迫要与一个毫无兴趣的人产生情感上的交集
Dialogue: 1,2:16:36.00,2:16:38.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但仔细想想这又有点奇怪
Dialogue: 1,2:16:38.90,2:16:42.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,会有人因为不得不去控制某些角色体会她的心路历程而感到不安
Dialogue: 1,2:16:42.61,2:16:45.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,以至于会直接关掉游戏彻底弃坑
Dialogue: 1,2:16:45.26,2:16:46.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,但还真就有
Dialogue: 1,2:16:46.97,2:16:50.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,真要说的话 我觉得这反而是对顽皮狗角色塑造能力的一种赞美
Dialogue: 1,2:16:50.92,2:16:56.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,正因为之前乔尔这个角色太有亲和力了
Dialogue: 1,2:16:56.19,2:17:01.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致玩家对他和以他为代表的这个想象中的角色会表现得非常忠诚
Dialogue: 1,2:17:01.97,2:17:08.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,使得玩家不愿意给杀死他的角色一丁点时间
Dialogue: 1,2:17:08.84,2:17:14.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也能完全想到顽皮狗内部做这个决定时会多么两极分化
Dialogue: 1,2:17:14.08,2:17:15.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,决定让埃比和艾莉都成为主角
Dialogue: 1,2:17:15.76,2:17:20.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,并让她们各自占一半的流程本应是开发流程中一个非常早的决定
Dialogue: 1,2:17:20.08,2:17:24.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,并让她们各自占一半的流程本应是开发流程中一个非常早的决定
Dialogue: 1,2:17:24.23,2:17:30.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,值得庆幸的是至少在我看来 在大多数情况下 游戏做的还相当不错
Dialogue: 1,2:17:30.47,2:17:34.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,我理解有些人一开始就不同意这样的安排
Dialogue: 1,2:17:34.70,2:17:38.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这不是问题所在 问题在于当前的安排是否执行顺利
Dialogue: 1,2:17:38.69,2:17:40.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在等我们看完了埃比的部分
Dialogue: 1,2:17:40.73,2:17:43.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就能跟大家多聊聊我认为的
Dialogue: 1,2:17:43.76,2:17:48.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们在呈现这两个角色方面是否取得了良好的平衡这件事了
Dialogue: 1,2:17:48.95,2:17:53.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为TLOU2的最大问题是它的节奏
Dialogue: 1,2:17:53.09,2:17:59.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,它真的很容易让人打瞌睡 失去注意力 特别是在游戏最后三分之一部分
Dialogue: 1,2:17:59.45,2:18:04.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟 TLOU2对玩家的要求很高
Dialogue: 1,2:18:04.01,2:18:09.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上要保持对正在发生的一切的兴趣并参与其中并不容易
Dialogue: 1,2:18:09.74,2:18:12.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是因为它在情感上如此令人心力交瘁
Dialogue: 1,2:18:12.59,2:18:15.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,但别担心 我们稍后会讨论这些问题
Dialogue: 1,2:18:15.32,2:18:16.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,你继续游玩这个关卡
Dialogue: 1,2:18:16.55,2:18:19.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终找到了被困于一些铁丝网中的斑马
Dialogue: 1,2:18:19.91,2:18:24.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比在欧文的协助下帮助她的父亲解救了它
Dialogue: 1,2:18:24.65,2:18:27.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后斑马和它刚出生的幼崽
Dialogue: 1,2:18:27.30,2:18:32.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,一起跑向了一代游戏结束时看到的圣玛莉医院对面的田野上
Dialogue: 1,2:18:32.81,2:18:36.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,一伙人刚刚得知马琳的女孩刚刚到了
Dialogue: 1,2:18:36.21,2:18:40.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且她好像真的像之前听说的那样具有免疫力
Dialogue: 1,2:18:40.85,2:18:42.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,说的当然就是艾莉了
Dialogue: 1,2:18:42.56,2:18:44.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像一代结尾一群人发现乔尔和艾莉之后一样
Dialogue: 1,2:18:44.93,2:18:48.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,镜头切到一代里的马琳和埃比的爸爸争吵
Dialogue: 1,2:18:48.74,2:18:52.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,否是要实施这场可能研发出疫苗的手术
Dialogue: 1,2:18:52.37,2:18:54.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,这其实是我们一直想看到的对话内容
Dialogue: 1,2:18:54.92,2:18:56.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比的父亲想做这台手术
Dialogue: 1,2:18:56.93,2:19:00.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,他觉得艾莉的牺牲将是值得的
Dialogue: 1,2:19:00.07,2:19:03.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这有可能会拯救成千上万条生命
Dialogue: 1,2:19:03.80,2:19:07.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,但问题在于他们不敢去征得艾莉或者乔尔的同意
Dialogue: 1,2:19:07.82,2:19:10.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们只能先斩后奏 事后请求原谅
Dialogue: 1,2:19:10.52,2:19:13.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果他们去找艾莉 那艾莉很可能会同意
Dialogue: 1,2:19:13.76,2:19:17.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果他们去找乔尔 那乔尔很可能会不同意
Dialogue: 1,2:19:17.15,2:19:21.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后我们发现 何止是不同意 他能把你们杀穿了
Dialogue: 1,2:19:21.53,2:19:26.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这段对话的末尾 埃比进来了 她给她父亲送一些晚餐
Dialogue: 1,2:19:26.06,2:19:29.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,而她之后说的话很有意思
Dialogue: 1,2:19:46.64,2:19:51.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,随后很快画面一黑 镜头来到了埃比跑进手术室的画面
Dialogue: 1,2:19:51.68,2:19:53.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,她发现她父亲已经死了
Dialogue: 1,2:20:15.02,2:20:18.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是埃比要杀乔尔的原因
Dialogue: 1,2:20:18.29,2:20:23.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,全都明白了 为了强调这一点 画面马上切到乔尔死的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:20:23.30,2:20:25.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来好像有点仓促 但我真的很喜欢这部分
Dialogue: 1,2:20:25.82,2:20:29.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为现在我们终于能听到之前在这里听不清的对话了
Dialogue: 1,2:20:29.56,2:20:31.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为现在我们终于能听到之前在这里听不清的对话了
Dialogue: 1,2:20:31.82,2:20:36.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们可以听到整段对话与人们的争论
Dialogue: 1,2:21:24.56,2:21:27.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里正式来到了游戏的中点
Dialogue: 1,2:21:27.62,2:21:30.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们可以看出的是 艾莉的游玩部分已经结束了
Dialogue: 1,2:21:30.95,2:21:34.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来画面出现了「西雅图 第1天」
Dialogue: 1,2:21:34.10,2:21:38.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,说明我们即将重新完整过一遍之前操控艾莉的这三天
Dialogue: 1,2:21:38.57,2:21:40.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这次是埃比的视角
Dialogue: 1,2:21:40.73,2:21:41.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的转换很有趣
Dialogue: 1,2:21:41.98,2:21:48.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这种视角的转换就是整个游戏叙事元素的核心
Dialogue: 1,2:21:48.80,2:21:55.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我不禁感觉很多玩家玩到这里 经历了刚刚那样的旅程 已经身心疲惫了
Dialogue: 1,2:21:55.67,2:21:59.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,也因此游戏到了这里 节奏的掌握就变得尤为重要
Dialogue: 1,2:21:59.12,2:22:01.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,你必须得让玩家兴奋起来
Dialogue: 1,2:22:01.25,2:22:07.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是考虑到很多玩家会感觉自己明明刚刚玩过这三天的内容了
Dialogue: 1,2:22:07.16,2:22:12.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在游戏却让我再操控另一个角色再玩一遍
Dialogue: 1,2:22:12.68,2:22:15.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且还是大家眼中的反派角色
Dialogue: 1,2:22:15.72,2:22:19.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏还想让我们陪她度过和艾莉一样的三天时间
Dialogue: 1,2:22:19.85,2:22:26.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,可我们早在2013年的一代游戏中就已经和艾莉建立深厚感情了
Dialogue: 1,2:22:26.93,2:22:28.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里真的有很多问题要问
Dialogue: 1,2:22:28.46,2:22:32.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我也真不会怨很多玩到这里决定弃坑的玩家
Dialogue: 1,2:22:32.75,2:22:39.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然他们可能永远也看不到埃比在剧院拿枪指着艾莉之后的故事了
Dialogue: 1,2:22:39.95,2:22:45.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者可能是快进 可能是之后就改看别人的视频流程云了
Dialogue: 1,2:22:45.02,2:22:51.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致最后 不少玩家会对游戏后半部分自带一个怀疑态度
Dialogue: 1,2:22:51.11,2:22:54.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,一进来都在拿放大镜找埃比可恨的原因
Dialogue: 1,2:22:54.53,2:22:59.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟 她做了一些我们很可能会认为是不可饶恕的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:22:59.63,2:23:04.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而 我想我们中的大多数人还是会有足够开放的心态来玩这个游戏
Dialogue: 1,2:23:04.34,2:23:08.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,看看游戏是否能说服他们埃比行为的合理性
Dialogue: 1,2:23:08.90,2:23:10.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我进行的那份调查当中
Dialogue: 1,2:23:10.44,2:23:15.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,绝大多数玩了这个游戏结果中途放弃的玩家
Dialogue: 1,2:23:15.59,2:23:18.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,几乎都是在这一时刻弃坑的
Dialogue: 1,2:23:18.74,2:23:25.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这些玩家更倾向于给游戏打低分 平均分在4~5左右
Dialogue: 1,2:23:25.61,2:23:29.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,而打通了整个游戏的玩家
Dialogue: 1,2:23:29.04,2:23:33.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,给游戏的打分多数在8~9分
Dialogue: 1,2:23:33.28,2:23:35.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,结论看起来还是很明显的
Dialogue: 1,2:23:35.90,2:23:39.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,那些给这个游戏证明自己的机会的玩家
Dialogue: 1,2:23:39.36,2:23:42.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,通关后还是很享受这款游戏的
Dialogue: 1,2:23:42.77,2:23:45.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,而那些决定中途放弃这款游戏的玩家
Dialogue: 1,2:23:45.01,2:23:48.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏体验就和正常做事半途而废的体验一样
Dialogue: 1,2:23:48.44,2:23:50.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,就这么简单
Dialogue: 1,2:23:50.09,2:23:55.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家需要给游戏一个证明自己的机会
Dialogue: 1,2:23:55.31,2:23:59.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏正在做的是说服你 你所恨的这个角色
Dialogue: 1,2:23:59.42,2:24:03.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,是一个有血有肉、有真情实感的活生生的人
Dialogue: 1,2:24:03.34,2:24:08.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,和你会觉得有亲和力的角色一样
Dialogue: 1,2:24:08.06,2:24:12.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个论点并不是在短短一两个小时的游戏过程中提出的
Dialogue: 1,2:24:12.98,2:24:16.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,这需要时间 需要很多努力
Dialogue: 1,2:24:16.43,2:24:20.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,更重要的是 还需要玩家开放的心态
Dialogue: 1,2:24:20.63,2:24:23.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,听起来有点像很多玩家都说的那样
Dialogue: 1,2:24:23.44,2:24:27.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,“你看你玩一半就弃坑了 就说你不喜欢这游戏
Dialogue: 1,2:24:27.32,2:24:30.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,那说明你没玩到点上 你就永远不会喜欢这个游戏”
Dialogue: 1,2:24:30.14,2:24:32.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而 我认为这里面有相当多的道理
Dialogue: 1,2:24:32.99,2:24:34.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我也说不好 欢迎大家讨论
Dialogue: 1,2:24:34.76,2:24:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我能说的是 当我一周目玩到这里的时候 我真的感觉身心俱疲
Dialogue: 1,2:24:41.30,2:24:47.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,游玩埃比的部分需要相当大的精力 无论是心理上还是肉体上
Dialogue: 1,2:24:47.96,2:24:50.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,伴随着精神的高度紧张 和各种血腥厮杀
Dialogue: 1,2:24:50.99,2:24:54.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段10-15小时的游玩内容真的很令人疲惫
Dialogue: 1,2:24:54.98,2:25:01.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且说实话 我玩到埃比章节的时候甚至也考虑过要不要休息一下
Dialogue: 1,2:25:01.10,2:25:05.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是决定埋头继续玩 给游戏一个它想要证明自己的机会
Dialogue: 1,2:25:05.78,2:25:09.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 我们开始操控埃比了
Dialogue: 1,2:25:09.65,2:25:14.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,节奏变了 态度变了 语气也变了
Dialogue: 1,2:25:14.13,2:25:19.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,更广泛地讲 角色的行为风格也完全变了
Dialogue: 1,2:25:19.52,2:25:25.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,在许多方面 无论是好是坏 都会让玩家感觉这是一个完全不同的游戏
Dialogue: 1,2:25:25.01,2:25:27.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但不要担心 我们会深入了解这一切
Dialogue: 1,2:25:27.29,2:25:28.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,「西雅图 第1天」
Dialogue: 1,2:25:28.62,2:25:31.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比醒来 游戏下半场开始
Dialogue: 1,2:25:31.64,2:25:35.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家操控这位大多数人眼中的反面角色
Dialogue: 1,2:25:35.87,2:25:38.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而这样的评价可能会在游戏结束后有所改变
Dialogue: 1,2:25:38.99,2:25:42.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然整个游戏都需要从不同角度去讲的
Dialogue: 1,2:25:42.29,2:25:44.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这方面游戏做得相对简单
Dialogue: 1,2:25:44.78,2:25:46.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏强迫玩家操控埃比
Dialogue: 1,2:25:46.96,2:25:53.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少到玩家开始喜欢这个角色 甚至爱上这个角色
Dialogue: 1,2:25:53.75,2:25:57.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者最少是让玩家忘记之前有多恨她
Dialogue: 1,2:25:57.80,2:25:59.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的转变不能一蹴而就
Dialogue: 1,2:25:59.18,2:26:02.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是需要8-12小时的游戏内容去慢慢渗透
Dialogue: 1,2:26:02.78,2:26:07.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,你才能慢慢缓解你对她曾经的恨意
Dialogue: 1,2:26:07.24,2:26:11.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里埃比和曼尼搭档 而他也在去杰克逊小镇的一行人中
Dialogue: 1,2:26:11.54,2:26:17.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会在这种非常轻松的场合中遇见很多人 这种感觉有点魔幻
Dialogue: 1,2:26:17.66,2:26:21.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,你恨这些人 他们杀死了乔尔
Dialogue: 1,2:26:21.32,2:26:26.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,为什么他们跟没事人一样吃得下饭睡得着觉
Dialogue: 1,2:26:26.76,2:26:32.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家探索WLF的基地 这里其实是由一个体育场改造而来的
Dialogue: 1,2:26:32.09,2:26:33.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,你准备出去执行任务
Dialogue: 1,2:26:33.80,2:26:38.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以自然要去拿枪 之前还吃了点卷饼 和狗狗玩了一会
Dialogue: 1,2:26:49.25,2:26:53.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 梅尔要和埃比、曼尼一起出去巡逻
Dialogue: 1,2:26:53.21,2:26:57.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 这就是刚刚艾莉杀死的那个女的
Dialogue: 1,2:26:57.57,2:27:00.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,那种奇妙感觉又来了
Dialogue: 1,2:27:00.14,2:27:04.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,你刚刚还看到这个女的遇害 而艾莉也精神近乎崩溃
Dialogue: 1,2:27:04.79,2:27:10.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,而埃比也因艾莉对梅尔和欧文的残忍行为而近乎崩溃
Dialogue: 1,2:27:10.73,2:27:16.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以在这里看到她活蹦乱跳的 感觉有点怪
Dialogue: 1,2:27:16.73,2:27:20.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比还和曼尼就梅尔应不应该一起和他们巡逻的事情争论了一会
Dialogue: 1,2:27:20.28,2:27:22.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比还和曼尼就梅尔应不应该一起和他们巡逻的事情争论了一会
Dialogue: 1,2:27:22.55,2:27:26.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟大家都看到她挺着大肚子
Dialogue: 1,2:27:26.39,2:27:29.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,但也没太在意 因为他们感觉不会出什么事
Dialogue: 1,2:27:29.36,2:27:31.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟他们只是出去快速巡逻一下
Dialogue: 1,2:27:31.73,2:27:34.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,保证外面没有什么让人担心的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:27:34.25,2:27:36.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,有的话呼叫增援就好了
Dialogue: 1,2:27:36.38,2:27:39.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,到那时梅尔在不在也无妨
Dialogue: 1,2:27:39.35,2:27:44.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我个人认为 带着这样一个身怀六甲的孕妇
Dialogue: 1,2:27:44.40,2:27:49.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,参加一场外出巡逻的军事行动仍然是很蠢的行为
Dialogue: 1,2:27:50.54,2:27:53.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,但可能只有我和埃比这样认为罢
Dialogue: 1,2:27:53.45,2:27:59.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段场景结束埃比还跟曼尼说不应该带梅尔来的
Dialogue: 1,2:27:59.07,2:28:02.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,还说从最开始就不应该允许她参加这次巡逻
Dialogue: 1,2:28:02.93,2:28:06.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之还是允许她来了
Dialogue: 1,2:28:06.60,2:28:12.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在既然说到梅尔 我们也知道她怀孕了 我们刚刚也看到她被艾莉杀害了
Dialogue: 1,2:28:12.26,2:28:15.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得有必要聊聊一个大家早已知道的问题
Dialogue: 1,2:28:15.20,2:28:17.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是有人认为这样安排毁了这场游戏
Dialogue: 1,2:28:17.99,2:28:23.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,即玩家此时已经知道了结局 所以感觉剧情没味了
Dialogue: 1,2:28:23.24,2:28:28.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,在玩过艾莉线后 我们知道这里很多角色最后会死
Dialogue: 1,2:28:28.57,2:28:32.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且更重要的是 我们会知道这些角色是什么时候 怎么死的
Dialogue: 1,2:28:32.89,2:28:39.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此这些玩家试图保护他们或与他们一起经历的情节
Dialogue: 1,2:28:39.17,2:28:43.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,会少了很多紧张感 因为我们都知道结局如何
Dialogue: 1,2:28:43.01,2:28:46.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而 我对这样的观点表示强烈不同意
Dialogue: 1,2:28:46.94,2:28:53.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,在已知结果的情况下 中间的故事会有无数种可能
Dialogue: 1,2:28:53.03,2:28:57.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家可以看看那些简单而刻奇的电影 比如《泰坦尼克号》
Dialogue: 1,2:28:57.05,2:29:02.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一部很俗但又很迷人的爱情电影
Dialogue: 1,2:29:02.48,2:29:06.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,就其核心而言 我们都知道故事结局如何
Dialogue: 1,2:29:06.59,2:29:10.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,泰坦尼克不可能像变魔术一样回到纽约
Dialogue: 1,2:29:10.55,2:29:15.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是会和很多人的生命一同沉入大洋
Dialogue: 1,2:29:15.14,2:29:18.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,但它仍然是一个有趣而吸引人的故事
Dialogue: 1,2:29:18.35,2:29:22.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为重要的不是故事的结果如何
Dialogue: 1,2:29:22.33,2:29:24.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是通往这个结果的过程
Dialogue: 1,2:29:24.86,2:29:28.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者另一个游戏中的例子是2018年的《战神》
Dialogue: 1,2:29:28.88,2:29:34.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们从游戏一开始就已经知道游戏结局是奎托斯和阿特柔斯
Dialogue: 1,2:29:34.20,2:29:38.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,将菲的骨灰撒在九界最高峰
Dialogue: 1,2:29:38.04,2:29:40.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们从一开始就知道结局如何
Dialogue: 1,2:29:40.49,2:29:45.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,而故事仍然很吸引人 因为重要的不只是结局
Dialogue: 1,2:29:45.76,2:29:48.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我觉得这是明摆着的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:29:48.65,2:29:55.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,但实际上对这种已知结局的故事的批判总是不少
Dialogue: 1,2:29:55.68,2:29:58.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我个人看来 如果你觉得一个故事被毁了
Dialogue: 1,2:29:58.64,2:30:03.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,仅仅是因为你知道了角色在故事最终会怎样
Dialogue: 1,2:30:03.41,2:30:11.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我认为你实际上并没有以一种正确 或者至少是最有效的方式去和游戏互动
Dialogue: 1,2:30:11.63,2:30:19.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,回到游戏 埃比和曼尼、梅尔 当然还有那条叫爱丽丝的狗一起上了卡车后座
Dialogue: 1,2:30:19.63,2:30:28.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,还记得我说艾莉在水族馆捅死的那条很快还会出现的狗吗
Dialogue: 1,2:30:28.01,2:30:31.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,呃……没错 就是这条
Dialogue: 1,2:30:31.28,2:30:36.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,它名叫爱丽丝 贼可爱 最后被艾莉捅死了
Dialogue: 1,2:30:36.67,2:30:38.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和梅尔聊了聊日常
Dialogue: 1,2:30:38.63,2:30:43.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然大家在杰克逊杀死乔尔之后都睡不好觉
Dialogue: 1,2:30:43.76,2:30:49.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和欧文不停接外出巡逻的活 想让自己忙起来
Dialogue: 1,2:30:49.02,2:30:52.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,忙到让自己没工夫去想自己做过的坏事
Dialogue: 1,2:30:52.52,2:30:54.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些可是受过军事训练的人
Dialogue: 1,2:30:54.72,2:30:58.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们却为自己对乔尔的所作所为感到无法释怀
Dialogue: 1,2:30:58.82,2:31:00.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,这很有趣
Dialogue: 1,2:31:00.03,2:31:03.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为至少表明他们对自己所作所为有些苦恼
Dialogue: 1,2:31:03.88,2:31:05.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至可能有点后悔
Dialogue: 1,2:31:05.75,2:31:10.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是使这些你一开始认为是反派的人展现其人性一面的第一步
Dialogue: 1,2:31:10.70,2:31:12.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,很微妙 但很有用
Dialogue: 1,2:31:12.89,2:31:17.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,它还打破了人们对埃比及其成员只是冷血杀手的看法
Dialogue: 1,2:31:17.66,2:31:20.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们是活生生的人 也会搞砸一些事情
Dialogue: 1,2:31:20.30,2:31:24.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他们会为一些不公平的事情感觉到后悔
Dialogue: 1,2:31:24.56,2:31:27.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者至少认为自己做了错误的选择
Dialogue: 1,2:31:27.23,2:31:32.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而这段对话被一群骑马搞伏击的赛拉菲特帮打断了
Dialogue: 1,2:31:32.93,2:31:35.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人挺讨厌这些战斗的
Dialogue: 1,2:31:35.45,2:31:41.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,瞄准很蹩脚 伤害也感觉不合理 简单来说就是不好对付
Dialogue: 1,2:31:41.48,2:31:43.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果对比其他汽车战
Dialogue: 1,2:31:43.37,2:31:48.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如之前和杰西把车开河里那段
Dialogue: 1,2:31:48.65,2:31:50.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,会发现两者是不太一样的
Dialogue: 1,2:31:50.84,2:31:55.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和杰西的那场从头到尾都有很多脚本参与
Dialogue: 1,2:31:55.62,2:31:58.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为脚本成分很重 让游戏感觉很公平
Dialogue: 1,2:31:58.40,2:32:00.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家并不需要太多操作
Dialogue: 1,2:32:00.89,2:32:06.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果在这场被赛拉菲特帮伏击的汽车战中你什么都不做的话
Dialogue: 1,2:32:06.92,2:32:09.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你就会被打死 然后重新读档
Dialogue: 1,2:32:09.88,2:32:14.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你必须进行这种蹩脚的游戏操作
Dialogue: 1,2:32:14.75,2:32:20.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,而对我来说 既然这种操作是被迫的 那我觉得就是一个值得批评的点
Dialogue: 1,2:32:20.72,2:32:23.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 埃比一行人终于到达安全地带
Dialogue: 1,2:32:23.72,2:32:25.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们穿过几座建筑
Dialogue: 1,2:32:25.61,2:32:30.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,解决掉几波感染者和赛拉菲特帮
Dialogue: 1,2:32:30.29,2:32:35.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,来到了一座加油站 发现自己又被另一波赛拉菲特帮伏击了
Dialogue: 1,2:32:35.18,2:32:37.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,我现在就感觉这些东西很臃肿
Dialogue: 1,2:32:37.49,2:32:39.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,而当我们谈论游戏节奏的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:32:39.26,2:32:44.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的臃肿是你在经历游戏这个阶段时最不想遇到的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:32:44.93,2:32:50.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家此时需要比他们在整个游戏中到此为止还要更高的参与度
Dialogue: 1,2:32:50.06,2:32:55.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为大多数人到这都会开始感到厌烦 因为它只是更多重复的东西
Dialogue: 1,2:32:55.37,2:32:57.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,的确有一些轻佻有趣的时刻
Dialogue: 1,2:32:57.29,2:33:01.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,也有一些令角色展现人性一面的时刻
Dialogue: 1,2:33:01.10,2:33:04.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这或许才是游戏这段内容中更有用的东西
Dialogue: 1,2:33:04.73,2:33:07.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,这并不是真的要让玩家超级投入
Dialogue: 1,2:33:07.37,2:33:12.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是要确保玩家慢慢开始与这些他们之前讨厌的人产生情感上的联系
Dialogue: 1,2:33:12.23,2:33:18.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,我知道要求我们既要有有趣的游戏内容 让玩家参与其中
Dialogue: 1,2:33:18.17,2:33:20.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,又要让玩家感受到这些角色人性的一面是很难的
Dialogue: 1,2:33:20.99,2:33:24.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,但尽管如此 我仍然希望能有一些更吸引人的东西
Dialogue: 1,2:33:24.62,2:33:28.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,我最喜欢的部分可能是埃比与梅尔讨论她恐高症的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:33:28.94,2:33:32.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一个很短 很容易被忽略的时刻
Dialogue: 1,2:33:32.39,2:33:34.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得真的很有爱
Dialogue: 1,2:34:01.58,2:34:05.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,在铁路线和加油站的一番混战过后
Dialogue: 1,2:34:05.33,2:34:06.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,一队WLF士兵
Dialogue: 1,2:34:06.98,2:34:10.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能是被几分钟之前的伏击引起的警报吸引过来的一队
Dialogue: 1,2:34:10.73,2:34:12.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,来到现场拯救了大家
Dialogue: 1,2:34:12.32,2:34:15.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,解决了所有攻击你们小队的赛拉菲特帮
Dialogue: 1,2:34:15.41,2:34:19.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们都脱困了 并且一起去了所谓的前线基地
Dialogue: 1,2:34:19.53,2:34:23.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,梅尔去处理伤口 埃比和曼尼去见伊萨克
Dialogue: 1,2:34:23.69,2:34:26.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们终于能见到这位老大了
Dialogue: 1,2:34:26.27,2:34:33.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,这位自从艾莉到西雅图以后在游戏中听了能有12小时的幕后大佬
Dialogue: 1,2:34:33.51,2:34:36.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,在去见伊萨克的路上 埃比和曼尼听说
Dialogue: 1,2:34:36.23,2:34:39.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,欧文和另一个小队分开了
Dialogue: 1,2:34:39.86,2:34:45.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他开枪打死的人——丹尼说欧文是为了保护“某位疤脸帮”
Dialogue: 1,2:34:45.89,2:34:50.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用说也知道 一旦此事被证实 那欧文无疑会被判死刑
Dialogue: 1,2:34:50.48,2:34:52.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们不知道到底发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,2:34:52.43,2:35:01.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果欧文真的只是为了他们眼中的野蛮人害虫就杀死了一名WLF士兵
Dialogue: 1,2:35:01.04,2:35:03.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,那一定会对欧文很不利
Dialogue: 1,2:35:03.08,2:35:05.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比和曼尼想去见伊萨克
Dialogue: 1,2:35:05.88,2:35:10.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,而伊萨克可能是整个游戏里登场方式看上去最邪恶的角色了
Dialogue: 1,2:36:00.47,2:36:03.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在伊萨克并不像让他们去救欧文
Dialogue: 1,2:36:03.24,2:36:08.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为WLF正在组织一场对疤脸帮的进攻 他需要人手
Dialogue: 1,2:36:08.03,2:36:11.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比说了句“去他的吧” 然后就去找欧文了
Dialogue: 1,2:36:11.17,2:36:13.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,要不然……没法演了啊
Dialogue: 1,2:36:13.04,2:36:14.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,我要说的有两点
Dialogue: 1,2:36:14.27,2:36:18.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,一方面 埃比留下其他人 自己去找欧文
Dialogue: 1,2:36:18.34,2:36:22.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,解释了为什么之前很多地方里艾莉寻找埃比的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:36:22.46,2:36:25.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比看起来总是擅离职守
Dialogue: 1,2:36:25.25,2:36:27.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,也解释了为什么埃比没和团队其他人在一起
Dialogue: 1,2:36:27.62,2:36:30.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,WLF方面对她很不满 想要追捕她
Dialogue: 1,2:36:30.73,2:36:34.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为她擅离职守 违抗伊萨克的命令
Dialogue: 1,2:36:34.19,2:36:37.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,这当然不代表她就不是艾莉的威胁了
Dialogue: 1,2:36:37.22,2:36:42.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,但却能说明她对单纯追求WLF的目标和愿望并不像艾莉最初想象的那样感兴趣
Dialogue: 1,2:36:42.56,2:36:47.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,但却能说明她对单纯追求WLF的目标和愿望并不像艾莉最初想象的那样感兴趣
Dialogue: 1,2:36:47.19,2:36:49.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比更像是一个独立的个体
Dialogue: 1,2:36:49.08,2:36:53.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,这甚至还是埃比和艾莉的共同点
Dialogue: 1,2:36:53.06,2:36:57.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一方面 埃比看起来好像很轻松就能擅离职守
Dialogue: 1,2:36:57.76,2:37:00.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,还能这样直接违抗命令
Dialogue: 1,2:37:00.35,2:37:02.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许只是她特别能干
Dialogue: 1,2:37:02.96,2:37:05.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以她能够偷偷溜走而不会有大问题
Dialogue: 1,2:37:05.96,2:37:09.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她看起来好像还很怕伊萨克
Dialogue: 1,2:37:09.02,2:37:14.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是他一登场我们就看到他在拷问一个人
Dialogue: 1,2:37:14.51,2:37:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以不管是她太傲慢了还是游戏在这方面设计欠考虑
Dialogue: 1,2:37:18.59,2:37:22.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比还是想办法出去自己找欧文了
Dialogue: 1,2:37:22.31,2:37:25.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 她希望的是自己能够救出欧文
Dialogue: 1,2:37:25.67,2:37:29.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,并且能在围攻赛拉菲特帮之前想出一些应对办法
Dialogue: 1,2:37:29.33,2:37:32.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,让其他人不会察觉到她曾经失踪了一段时间
Dialogue: 1,2:37:32.00,2:37:37.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后画面很快切到埃比和欧文曾经一次短暂的约会
Dialogue: 1,2:37:37.30,2:37:40.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们在一座摩天轮上 这段场景也很有趣
Dialogue: 1,2:37:40.49,2:37:43.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们再一次看到了埃比对高处的恐惧
Dialogue: 1,2:37:43.19,2:37:49.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,再一次看到了她在欧文面前表现出害怕恐惧的人性一面
Dialogue: 1,2:37:49.46,2:37:54.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而这就又到了讨论叙事节奏问题的时候了
Dialogue: 1,2:37:54.59,2:37:58.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里在讲什么？为何节奏如此缓慢？
Dialogue: 1,2:37:58.46,2:38:06.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,为什么我们要融入这段我们不太了解 甚至多数人完全不关心的角色的回忆？
Dialogue: 1,2:38:06.44,2:38:12.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们什么时候能进入一段更有趣更快速的叙事片段？
Dialogue: 1,2:38:12.41,2:38:18.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许可能只有我这样 喜欢节奏更快一点的叙事片段
Dialogue: 1,2:38:18.86,2:38:20.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我希望多来点
Dialogue: 1,2:38:20.60,2:38:25.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,可也许这部游戏就是这样 所以节奏上可能没我想的那么糟
Dialogue: 1,2:38:25.43,2:38:30.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在即将到来的西雅图第2天和第3天的内容中
Dialogue: 1,2:38:30.62,2:38:34.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏中很多片段真的开始大大放慢节奏了
Dialogue: 1,2:38:34.79,2:38:36.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也不是很懂……欢迎在评论区讨论
Dialogue: 1,2:38:36.83,2:38:38.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这场约会还是很暖的
Dialogue: 1,2:38:38.24,2:38:44.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,在水族馆的最后 埃比和欧文俩人在亲亲
Dialogue: 1,2:38:44.03,2:38:47.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比突然打断 她自己有些心事
Dialogue: 1,2:38:47.81,2:38:50.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果发现是她还在想乔尔的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:38:50.45,2:38:55.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们正想办法找他 从而实施某种报复
Dialogue: 1,2:38:55.76,2:38:59.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,欧文似乎对这种复仇并没有很深的执念
Dialogue: 1,2:38:59.18,2:39:03.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,尽管从我们可以看出他确实和埃比的父亲很熟
Dialogue: 1,2:39:03.83,2:39:06.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他也懂这对埃比意义重大
Dialogue: 1,2:39:06.92,2:39:09.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他选择顺着埃比的意思 至少多数部分是这样
Dialogue: 1,2:39:09.62,2:39:13.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们明白的是 这点是埃比的诉求 是她想要的
Dialogue: 1,2:39:13.61,2:39:17.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且在找到并杀死乔尔之前她是不会放弃的
Dialogue: 1,2:39:17.39,2:39:20.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,她多次提到他们要回去训练
Dialogue: 1,2:39:20.15,2:39:24.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,也解释了为什么她当前不是那么壮
Dialogue: 1,2:39:24.05,2:39:26.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少和“现在”那个手撕感染者、大战艾莉帮时候的肌肉块相比
Dialogue: 1,2:39:26.87,2:39:33.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少和“现在”那个手撕感染者、大战艾莉帮时候的肌肉块相比
Dialogue: 1,2:39:33.62,2:39:37.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么我认为在很多时候她的身体状况和外表
Dialogue: 1,2:39:37.68,2:39:40.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,是她精神状态的直接反映
Dialogue: 1,2:39:40.19,2:39:44.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么在游戏的后期 当她被复仇的艾莉追击时
Dialogue: 1,2:39:44.39,2:39:48.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个人瘦了很多 没那么大块头了
Dialogue: 1,2:39:48.89,2:39:52.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,但抛开节奏问题 其实游戏真的体现出它的作用了
Dialogue: 1,2:39:52.19,2:39:55.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我发现自己真的开始关心埃比和欧文
Dialogue: 1,2:39:55.34,2:39:59.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,开始感兴趣他们的人生道路上到底发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,2:39:59.27,2:40:04.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,说起来有点离奇 但我真的开始为杀害乔尔的凶手而感到难过
Dialogue: 1,2:40:04.28,2:40:08.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后镜头来到了在WLF领土边界的埃比和曼尼
Dialogue: 1,2:40:08.72,2:40:14.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,她要去找欧文 而出于某种原因曼尼留她独自前往
Dialogue: 1,2:40:14.33,2:40:18.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,他说这样不会引起太多注意 也不至于让他们惹上伊萨克的麻烦
Dialogue: 1,2:40:18.83,2:40:20.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,说是这么说
Dialogue: 1,2:40:20.57,2:40:24.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,但感觉曼尼能让她一个人去还是有点牵强
Dialogue: 1,2:40:24.53,2:40:27.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得还能接受 又不是什么大事
Dialogue: 1,2:40:27.74,2:40:31.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在这里游戏的引导系统非常有趣
Dialogue: 1,2:40:31.25,2:40:34.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,设计得非常精巧 非常美
Dialogue: 1,2:40:34.31,2:40:37.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家要做的 就是跟着日落
Dialogue: 1,2:40:37.46,2:40:39.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,非常简单 又非常优美
Dialogue: 1,2:40:39.29,2:40:43.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的指引在你探索一个关卡时简单易懂
Dialogue: 1,2:40:43.70,2:40:47.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为TLOU2中的很多光照都是环境光
Dialogue: 1,2:40:47.57,2:40:52.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家总会与外面照进来的光线方向一致
Dialogue: 1,2:40:52.20,2:40:55.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我不得不说 当我在探索这些关卡的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:40:55.52,2:41:00.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,我会让自己根据从窗户射进来的光源调整自己的方向
Dialogue: 1,2:41:00.14,2:41:05.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,我发现这个过程非常自然 而这个设计的实现是如此流畅 感觉真的很酷
Dialogue: 1,2:41:05.75,2:41:08.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,我自己已经不记得上一个
Dialogue: 1,2:41:08.08,2:41:12.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,使用类似的光源引导玩家的游戏了
Dialogue: 1,2:41:12.56,2:41:14.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这真的很新鲜
Dialogue: 1,2:41:14.81,2:41:20.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 很多游戏都使用地图坐标来为玩家指出正确的方向
Dialogue: 1,2:41:20.21,2:41:22.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们会直接告诉你往北还是往西
Dialogue: 1,2:41:22.32,2:41:26.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者是屏幕上有个罗盘 让你自己知道该去哪
Dialogue: 1,2:41:26.66,2:41:28.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得这是两码事
Dialogue: 1,2:41:28.75,2:41:31.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,一方面 这会让你不停地去看游戏里的罗盘
Dialogue: 1,2:41:31.76,2:41:35.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如《上古卷轴V：天际》 如果你想知道自己的方向
Dialogue: 1,2:41:35.60,2:41:38.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,且你又碰巧不是那么了解地图的话
Dialogue: 1,2:41:38.69,2:41:42.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,你那就不得不抬眼看一下上面的罗盘 找到你要去的地方
Dialogue: 1,2:41:42.32,2:41:44.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个过程中你的眼睛从游戏画面中移开
Dialogue: 1,2:41:44.08,2:41:47.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,从工作室的所有开发人员花费数年时间制作的所有惊人的艺术作品上移开
Dialogue: 1,2:41:47.08,2:41:51.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,从工作室的所有开发人员花费数年时间制作的所有惊人的艺术作品上移开
Dialogue: 1,2:41:51.29,2:41:56.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,我一直认为这是开放世界游戏设计的一个真正的悲剧
Dialogue: 1,2:41:56.33,2:41:59.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,开发者辛苦花费这么多时间创造的精美游戏内容
Dialogue: 1,2:41:59.33,2:42:04.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,但却让玩家因为简单的探索寻路过程而完全分心
Dialogue: 1,2:42:04.88,2:42:07.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这两件事本应是共同推进的
Dialogue: 1,2:42:07.34,2:42:11.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是为什么我非常喜欢把屏幕上UI界面完全打散的方式
Dialogue: 1,2:42:11.69,2:42:13.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,我只是感觉这样不太值
Dialogue: 1,2:42:13.43,2:42:17.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是当还有其他选择的时候 比如游戏内UI
Dialogue: 1,2:42:17.92,2:42:20.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如像《死亡搁浅》这样的游戏
Dialogue: 1,2:42:20.26,2:42:24.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,当你想导航去某处送货的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:42:24.53,2:42:26.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会在地图上设定好路径点
Dialogue: 1,2:42:26.72,2:42:31.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后 当你在游戏世界里向着目的地进发的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:42:31.34,2:42:37.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会发现你所有的目标点都点缀在了游戏的地形当中
Dialogue: 1,2:42:37.82,2:42:42.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,这使得游戏指引你去目的地的导航过程
Dialogue: 1,2:42:42.11,2:42:46.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,并没有把你的思绪从游戏世界中拉出来
Dialogue: 1,2:42:46.13,2:42:48.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,相反 它能让你更加融入其中
Dialogue: 1,2:42:48.83,2:42:53.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,这会让你注意到每一座山峰 每一条山脊
Dialogue: 1,2:42:53.51,2:42:58.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,这才是这类开放世界游戏真正展现光芒的时刻
Dialogue: 1,2:42:58.37,2:43:04.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我真诚地相信 这就是为什么《死亡搁浅》即使其世界在主观上相当空洞
Dialogue: 1,2:43:04.34,2:43:08.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,但仍能以如此引人入胜 吸引玩家眼球
Dialogue: 1,2:43:08.48,2:43:10.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 如果你想听我关于这款游戏的全部想法
Dialogue: 1,2:43:10.64,2:43:13.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,可以去看我完整的《死亡搁浅》评测
Dialogue: 1,2:43:13.55,2:43:15.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,两个多小时 有亿点点长
Dialogue: 1,2:43:15.89,2:43:19.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,但你既然这个视频都看了这么久 那你可能已经看过那个了
Dialogue: 1,2:43:19.68,2:43:23.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 我认为顽皮狗在埃比这部分关卡中引导玩家的设计
Dialogue: 1,2:43:23.56,2:43:27.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 我认为顽皮狗在埃比这部分关卡中引导玩家的设计
Dialogue: 1,2:43:27.82,2:43:30.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,是非常了不起的 我吹爆
Dialogue: 1,2:43:30.26,2:43:35.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,把让玩家跟随阳光这样简单的事情被实现得如此之好
Dialogue: 1,2:43:35.67,2:43:38.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这绝对是惊人的成就
Dialogue: 1,2:43:38.81,2:43:43.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,随便一个工作室都能做一个要求玩家跟随阳光的关卡场景
Dialogue: 1,2:43:43.37,2:43:49.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但要让阳光贯穿于玩家进入的每个场景、每个区域、每个房间
Dialogue: 1,2:43:49.40,2:43:54.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,让他们清楚地知道下一步要去哪里 这就非常有难度了
Dialogue: 1,2:43:54.02,2:43:58.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 在这种引导下 埃比一路西行前往水族馆
Dialogue: 1,2:43:58.76,2:44:00.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,她认为欧文就藏在那里
Dialogue: 1,2:44:00.56,2:44:05.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,她想和欧文谈谈 因为她需要弄清楚他到底为什么要枪杀丹尼
Dialogue: 1,2:44:05.72,2:44:08.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及故事是否还有反转
Dialogue: 1,2:44:08.72,2:44:10.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这个相对平静的游戏内容中
Dialogue: 1,2:44:10.91,2:44:15.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,你主要是在收集弹药、探索建筑、找找收集品
Dialogue: 1,2:44:15.50,2:44:18.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,这真的是暴风雨前的平静 因为在这之后
Dialogue: 1,2:44:18.88,2:44:22.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏就真的开始全程高能直到结尾
Dialogue: 1,2:44:22.76,2:44:27.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这个高能就是从埃比爬入墙缝里的时候开始的
Dialogue: 1,2:44:27.38,2:44:29.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,呃……然后就……
Dialogue: 1,2:44:55.52,2:44:59.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真的很喜欢这种“你安全了……吗？”的设计
Dialogue: 1,2:44:59.84,2:45:04.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像之前提到的 艾莉在工作台升级武器的时候被偷袭
Dialogue: 1,2:45:04.79,2:45:07.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像之前提到的 艾莉在工作台升级武器的时候被偷袭
Dialogue: 1,2:45:07.99,2:45:13.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,而现在埃比在一个看上去很隐蔽的、让你以为游戏在读条的空间里
Dialogue: 1,2:45:13.49,2:45:15.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,也被突然吓了一跳
Dialogue: 1,2:45:15.00,2:45:19.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,我……我真的感觉这太爽了 可能我算是这样想的少数人吧
Dialogue: 1,2:45:19.76,2:45:22.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我真的感觉这样很有观感
Dialogue: 1,2:45:22.07,2:45:26.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也让我回想起艾莉和乔尔之前的片段 两人在墙缝中缓缓前行时
Dialogue: 1,2:45:26.84,2:45:30.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,巨无霸把墙里的艾莉一把拽出来
Dialogue: 1,2:45:30.38,2:45:32.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,引发接下来的Boss战
Dialogue: 1,2:45:32.09,2:45:36.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能这也是一处类比让你感觉两人是相似的 有关联的吧
Dialogue: 1,2:45:36.92,2:45:39.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但也可能是我过度解读了
Dialogue: 1,2:45:39.29,2:45:43.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,在关卡的最后 你会遇到当年隔离区的一个检查点
Dialogue: 1,2:45:54.86,2:45:59.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里设置了一个神龛 专门用来供奉赛拉菲特教的先知大人
Dialogue: 1,2:45:59.42,2:46:05.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,神龛周围还有各种纸条 都在向她索要各种东西
Dialogue: 1,2:46:05.78,2:46:07.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想这让玩家意识到
Dialogue: 1,2:46:07.73,2:46:12.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,赛拉菲特帮与WLF有多大的不同 艾莉也同样意识到了这一点
Dialogue: 1,2:46:12.08,2:46:17.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在我们还未见到过这位女先知 实际上我喜欢这样的设定
Dialogue: 1,2:46:17.21,2:46:21.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像我们最终也没有和伊萨克有过Boss战
Dialogue: 1,2:46:21.68,2:46:27.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,放到一般游戏 介绍了这样的大人物却什么都不做简直是大罪过
Dialogue: 1,2:46:27.35,2:46:30.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果玩家看到游戏中介绍了某个大坏蛋
Dialogue: 1,2:46:30.83,2:46:35.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你很可能会和ta打一场Boss战
Dialogue: 1,2:46:35.24,2:46:37.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,否则最开始就不会介绍这个人
Dialogue: 1,2:46:37.94,2:46:41.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能只有我这样想吧 但我真的很高兴顽皮狗能打破这个常规
Dialogue: 1,2:46:41.75,2:46:44.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些角色还是他们自己
Dialogue: 1,2:46:44.92,2:46:48.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是偶尔会放进Playstation的奖杯列表里
Dialogue: 1,2:46:48.84,2:46:50.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在说到这个女先知
Dialogue: 1,2:46:50.40,2:46:54.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者游戏中更多人只是叫她“先知”
Dialogue: 1,2:46:54.93,2:46:57.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们实际上并没有发现很多关于她的事情
Dialogue: 1,2:46:57.89,2:47:02.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,我做了很多调查 试图弄清楚这位女士曾经究竟是谁
Dialogue: 1,2:47:02.03,2:47:08.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,我说“曾经” 因为游戏暗示她实际上在二代游戏故事之前就已经遇害了
Dialogue: 1,2:47:08.15,2:47:13.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,似乎在疫情爆发 西雅图陷入一片混乱后不久
Dialogue: 1,2:47:13.46,2:47:17.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这位女士就成为了一个小型邪教团体的领袖
Dialogue: 1,2:47:17.24,2:47:22.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,她宣称虫草菌实际上是对人类过度依赖科学技术的惩罚
Dialogue: 1,2:47:22.15,2:47:24.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,她宣称虫草菌实际上是对人类过度依赖科学技术的惩罚
Dialogue: 1,2:47:24.80,2:47:32.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 她自然而然地规定她的所有追随者从事长年累月艰苦的体力劳动
Dialogue: 1,2:47:32.36,2:47:38.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,躬耕于田 以符合自然本身的方式生产自己的食物
Dialogue: 1,2:47:38.84,2:47:42.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这显然也导致了赛拉菲特帮严格的生活方式
Dialogue: 1,2:47:42.47,2:47:45.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他们愿意追随女先知的指引 愿意这样做
Dialogue: 1,2:47:45.53,2:47:49.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后 在某个时刻 因为某种原因 她死了
Dialogue: 1,2:47:49.46,2:47:54.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,就我所知 没有人提到她到底是怎么死的
Dialogue: 1,2:47:54.62,2:47:58.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你发现了什么 欢迎在评论区告诉我 我很想听听
Dialogue: 1,2:47:58.61,2:48:02.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我在游戏中多次深挖后
Dialogue: 1,2:48:02.21,2:48:06.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是无法找到任何详细说明她具体如何死亡的资料
Dialogue: 1,2:48:06.47,2:48:08.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们知道的是 在她死后不久
Dialogue: 1,2:48:08.72,2:48:13.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,赛拉菲特教会的其他长老接管了大权
Dialogue: 1,2:48:13.31,2:48:19.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,并开始加强邪教的关键因素——对人的控制
Dialogue: 1,2:48:19.79,2:48:24.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,自然 许多新掌权者开始陷入腐败状态
Dialogue: 1,2:48:24.32,2:48:29.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们开始霸占更多的食物 开始控制不同的领土
Dialogue: 1,2:48:29.36,2:48:30.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,而在教徒们发现之前
Dialogue: 1,2:48:30.59,2:48:34.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,赛拉菲特帮崇拜的就已经不是与自然不协调的生活
Dialogue: 1,2:48:34.82,2:48:41.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是越来越多对人思想的控制 与对长老命令的严格遵守
Dialogue: 1,2:48:41.75,2:48:44.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是顽皮狗编剧们的一个有趣的设定
Dialogue: 1,2:48:44.48,2:48:50.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是由于其让赛拉菲特教徒更加让人同情
Dialogue: 1,2:48:50.42,2:48:51.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,每当你觉得
Dialogue: 1,2:48:51.72,2:48:57.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们为了达到某种目的而采用了一些非常禽兽、野蛮的手段
Dialogue: 1,2:48:57.38,2:49:03.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如将人开膛破肚是为了让他升上天堂之类的
Dialogue: 1,2:49:03.11,2:49:05.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,你总是可以回头借口说是这一切是有原因的
Dialogue: 1,2:49:05.92,2:49:10.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这些人只是遵循他们认为的来自宗教高层的指示
Dialogue: 1,2:49:10.94,2:49:19.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,大多数赛拉菲特教徒不是因为喜欢就去做一些罪大恶极的事情的大恶人
Dialogue: 1,2:49:19.31,2:49:25.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,相反 他们只是试图在这样一个礼坏乐崩的世界中谋求生存的受害者
Dialogue: 1,2:49:25.10,2:49:28.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家这样的一个思想观点刚好是在
Dialogue: 1,2:49:28.16,2:49:35.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比开始对之前邪教的成员感到同情的时间点建立起来的
Dialogue: 1,2:49:35.39,2:49:37.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,再次强调 整部游戏都是关于视角的
Dialogue: 1,2:49:37.88,2:49:40.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,它的目的是试图让你同情那些你以前认为自己不可能同情的人
Dialogue: 1,2:49:40.91,2:49:44.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,它的目的是试图让你同情那些你以前认为自己不可能同情的人
Dialogue: 1,2:49:44.28,2:49:47.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,重点是 先知是一个非常有趣的角色
Dialogue: 1,2:49:47.93,2:49:53.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是考虑到她对赛拉菲特教徒思想上的控制
Dialogue: 1,2:49:53.36,2:49:58.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而由于没有太多关于何时死亡或如何死亡的细节
Dialogue: 1,2:49:58.16,2:50:01.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们不清楚她究竟死了多久
Dialogue: 1,2:50:01.52,2:50:04.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果她只死了几年 那是一回事
Dialogue: 1,2:50:04.82,2:50:07.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这个时间可以慢慢往上加
Dialogue: 1,2:50:07.28,2:50:12.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果她已经死了十年十五年 导致了十多年的权力斗争
Dialogue: 1,2:50:12.29,2:50:18.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终滋生了这样病态的邪教 那就完全是另一回事了
Dialogue: 1,2:50:18.62,2:50:21.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 我觉得赛拉菲特帮的设定还是挺有意思的
Dialogue: 1,2:50:21.83,2:50:23.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少他们是一个而与众不同的团体
Dialogue: 1,2:50:23.68,2:50:31.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且他们提供了一种一群人如何在这样崩坏的世界里生存的崭新视角
Dialogue: 1,2:50:31.04,2:50:36.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,我特别喜欢这点 因为通常这类故事里出现的都是
Dialogue: 1,2:50:36.84,2:50:42.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,食人族、野蛮部落或者只知道烧杀抢掠的之类
Dialogue: 1,2:50:42.11,2:50:45.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,基本都是你在一代游戏里遇到的那样
Dialogue: 1,2:50:45.29,2:50:52.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 只有存在与众不同的点 才能让这些故事更有趣、更有创意
Dialogue: 1,2:50:52.91,2:50:58.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如《疯狂麦克斯》里的人对汽车、汽油的疯狂迷恋与崇拜
Dialogue: 1,2:50:58.79,2:51:01.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种与众不同就让人感觉真的很酷
Dialogue: 1,2:51:01.64,2:51:02.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,扯远了
Dialogue: 1,2:51:02.90,2:51:08.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比在通过这段检查点后就算正式进入疤脸帮的领地范围了
Dialogue: 1,2:51:08.24,2:51:11.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里我们会和大量的疤脸帮作战
Dialogue: 1,2:51:11.59,2:51:15.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且相信我 等打到这关结尾你会杀一大堆的疤脸帮
Dialogue: 1,2:51:23.09,2:51:26.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且这部分很多Boss战我非常喜欢
Dialogue: 1,2:51:26.06,2:51:29.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个女boss 我暂且叫她海尔格
Dialogue: 1,2:51:29.12,2:51:32.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道她真名叫什么
Dialogue: 1,2:51:32.12,2:51:34.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她一看就感觉太海尔格了
Dialogue: 1,2:51:34.28,2:51:38.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,呃……反正最后埃比把她的耳朵咬下来一块 我觉得挺逗的
Dialogue: 1,2:51:38.93,2:51:41.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她又叫来了一群帮手
Dialogue: 1,2:51:41.00,2:51:43.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们按住了埃比 把她打晕了
Dialogue: 1,2:51:43.10,2:51:47.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,画面来到了四个月前的闪回
Dialogue: 1,2:51:47.55,2:51:52.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段闪回刚好发生在游戏序章以前
Dialogue: 1,2:51:52.43,2:51:55.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和她的整个小队准备出发前往杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,2:51:55.55,2:52:00.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,时值冬日 埃比发现欧文在水族馆里架起了好多彩灯
Dialogue: 1,2:52:00.32,2:52:01.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,很惬意
Dialogue: 1,2:52:01.73,2:52:08.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,TLOU2游戏后半部分这样的节奏变换与对比很常见
Dialogue: 1,2:52:08.70,2:52:10.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,先发生了一些坏事
Dialogue: 1,2:52:10.52,2:52:13.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后给玩家看一些轻松愉快的内容
Dialogue: 1,2:52:13.16,2:52:16.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后更糟糕的事情发生
Dialogue: 1,2:52:16.19,2:52:19.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后切回冬日里这样的温馨画面
Dialogue: 1,2:52:19.68,2:52:24.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里有很多互动小游戏 你可以拿玩具弓箭射一堆目标
Dialogue: 1,2:52:24.17,2:52:29.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,看着挺蠢的 但能让玩家不用看枯燥无味的对话
Dialogue: 1,2:52:29.15,2:52:37.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,否则这段闪回就纯粹是埃比和欧文俩人唠嗑、上楼、再唠十块钱的画面了
Dialogue: 1,2:52:37.04,2:52:42.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,倒不是说顽皮狗不敢在游戏里放长达十分钟的过场动画
Dialogue: 1,2:52:42.44,2:52:45.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我感觉他们是能避免就避免
Dialogue: 1,2:52:45.47,2:52:49.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们会穿插这样的小游戏来打破单调的气氛
Dialogue: 1,2:52:49.48,2:52:53.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过现在这一段剧情的重点是告诉玩家 埃比找到了汤米
Dialogue: 1,2:52:53.45,2:52:57.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者至少知道他住在杰克逊小镇了
Dialogue: 1,2:52:57.56,2:53:02.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然了 重点是他们希望汤米能帮助他们找到乔尔
Dialogue: 1,2:53:02.48,2:53:05.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我们当然也知道乔尔其实也住在杰克逊
Dialogue: 1,2:53:05.24,2:53:08.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,但显然这时埃比并不知道此事
Dialogue: 1,2:53:08.09,2:53:14.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少我不清楚埃比在开场时是否仍认为他们只在寻找汤米
Dialogue: 1,2:53:14.81,2:53:18.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者到那时她是否认为乔尔也可能在那里
Dialogue: 1,2:53:18.02,2:53:22.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为一些对话显示出她肯定想要去找乔尔
Dialogue: 1,2:53:22.79,2:53:25.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们以为自己只能先找到汤米
Dialogue: 1,2:53:25.25,2:53:28.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然了 我说过我认为这没那么重要
Dialogue: 1,2:53:28.01,2:53:32.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,重点是 他们要去杰克逊小镇 通过汤米这条线索找乔尔
Dialogue: 1,2:53:32.78,2:53:35.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果乔尔也在那 那妥了
Dialogue: 1,2:53:35.03,2:53:41.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们预想是先找到汤米 然后希望能从他口中套出乔尔在哪之类的消息
Dialogue: 1,2:53:41.42,2:53:45.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 在埃比告诉欧文自己有一条乔尔弟弟的线索后
Dialogue: 1,2:53:45.78,2:53:49.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,她还告诉欧文伊萨克批准了执行这次行动的小队
Dialogue: 1,2:53:49.82,2:53:52.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,允许他们离开几周去追杀乔尔
Dialogue: 1,2:53:52.88,2:53:56.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,她说艾萨克比谁都坚持正义
Dialogue: 1,2:53:56.69,2:54:03.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他才会允许这些人离开西雅图几周 甚至几个月的时间
Dialogue: 1,2:54:03.21,2:54:07.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,去追杀一个好几年前做了一些坏事的人
Dialogue: 1,2:54:07.79,2:54:11.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人感觉伊萨克能允许这么多人离开挺牵强的
Dialogue: 1,2:54:11.90,2:54:16.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其还有不少要参加巡逻、戍守WLF边防的年轻新兵
Dialogue: 1,2:54:16.12,2:54:19.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其还有不少要参加巡逻、戍守WLF边防的年轻新兵
Dialogue: 1,2:54:19.22,2:54:21.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,但可能只有我这么想吧
Dialogue: 1,2:54:21.84,2:54:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许让他们离开这件事是符合伊萨克的性格的 而我却感觉牵强
Dialogue: 1,2:54:28.22,2:54:31.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,在一阵争辩过后 他们决定了
Dialogue: 1,2:54:31.40,2:54:34.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们要去杰克逊寻找汤米
Dialogue: 1,2:54:34.70,2:54:38.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后尝试找到乔尔复仇 了结这一切
Dialogue: 1,2:54:38.93,2:54:41.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,画面切回丛林里
Dialogue: 1,2:54:41.15,2:54:46.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,这其实是我们很多年前在预告片里第一次看到埃比的场景
Dialogue: 1,2:54:46.64,2:54:49.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我还记得我第一次看这个预告片的时候
Dialogue: 1,2:54:49.22,2:54:53.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,我还猜埃比这人会不会最后发现是艾莉的妈妈
Dialogue: 1,2:54:53.54,2:54:55.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,但……好吧……
Dialogue: 1,2:54:55.34,2:54:56.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,我猜错了
Dialogue: 1,2:54:56.72,2:54:58.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,错得离谱
Dialogue: 1,2:54:58.76,2:55:01.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,疤脸帮把埃比吊起来准备处刑
Dialogue: 1,2:55:01.30,2:55:04.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,却被他们刚抓来的一个女孩中断了
Dialogue: 1,2:55:17.51,2:55:21.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们目前还不知道这是什么意思 但简单来讲的话
Dialogue: 1,2:55:21.11,2:55:25.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个叫雅拉的女孩和其他的 不知道是谁的叛徒
Dialogue: 1,2:55:25.07,2:55:27.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,做了一些事情激怒了疤脸帮
Dialogue: 1,2:55:27.41,2:55:34.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,在雅拉向那个疤脸帮长老吐口水之后 她下令“折断她的翅膀”
Dialogue: 1,2:55:34.61,2:55:35.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我不得不说
Dialogue: 1,2:55:35.78,2:55:40.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我看完才这段操作发现这分明是属于暴力拆解
Dialogue: 1,2:55:40.22,2:55:44.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,另一个叛徒后来也现身了 名字叫勒弗
Dialogue: 1,2:55:44.45,2:55:47.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,他向赛拉菲特帮射了几箭
Dialogue: 1,2:55:47.00,2:55:48.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,解决掉了几个
Dialogue: 1,2:55:48.38,2:55:52.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,又和长老纠缠了一会 也把她解决掉了
Dialogue: 1,2:55:52.26,2:55:57.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后勒弗听从雅拉的指示 把埃比放了下来 差点就要被勒死了
Dialogue: 1,2:55:57.38,2:55:59.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 她刚才可太悬了
Dialogue: 1,2:55:59.48,2:56:05.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们杀死长老后就让她吊在那 太扯了
Dialogue: 1,2:56:05.51,2:56:10.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,但……埃比还真就在那吊了一会
Dialogue: 1,2:56:10.80,2:56:14.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,放埃比下来后 他们开始准备对抗感染者
Dialogue: 1,2:56:14.18,2:56:17.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,怕你们忘 提醒你们一下这游戏是有感染者的
Dialogue: 1,2:56:17.42,2:56:20.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为到这时好像好久没看到感染者了
Dialogue: 1,2:56:20.48,2:56:22.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里有一点很有趣 值得注意一下
Dialogue: 1,2:56:22.80,2:56:29.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比脖子上这条勒出的伤痕会一直伴随埃比后半段的游戏
Dialogue: 1,2:56:29.36,2:56:31.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个细节很棒 提高了游戏的沉浸体验
Dialogue: 1,2:56:31.49,2:56:34.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其等稍后的场景里
Dialogue: 1,2:56:34.58,2:56:37.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可以看到埃比用手揉自己的脖子 因为还很疼
Dialogue: 1,2:56:37.97,2:56:40.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟当了那么久的晴天娃娃
Dialogue: 1,2:56:40.70,2:56:43.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗可是出了名的喜欢钻细节
Dialogue: 1,2:56:43.74,2:56:45.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点没得黑
Dialogue: 1,2:56:45.68,2:56:48.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些场景之间的拍摄可能隔了几个月
Dialogue: 1,2:56:48.87,2:56:52.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,有时可能还要经历数年后重写 重拍
Dialogue: 1,2:56:52.82,2:56:55.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后围绕其对游戏关卡进行修改
Dialogue: 1,2:56:55.34,2:56:58.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后关卡改了 过场又要跟着重拍
Dialogue: 1,2:56:58.40,2:57:02.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,从这样大量的细节就能看出他们有多在乎此事
Dialogue: 1,2:57:02.40,2:57:07.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们会记录下角色身上发生的一切事情
Dialogue: 1,2:57:07.23,2:57:11.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样即使过了几个月 他们也可能翻出来 想想说
Dialogue: 1,2:57:11.03,2:57:14.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,“诶 埃比在这吊了这么久 是不是脖子应该疼啊
Dialogue: 1,2:57:14.78,2:57:19.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,在游戏的时间里她也刚被放下来几小时
Dialogue: 1,2:57:19.10,2:57:22.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你应该在人物表演中表现出这一点”
Dialogue: 1,2:57:22.43,2:57:25.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种水平的细节追求是非常罕见的
Dialogue: 1,2:57:25.16,2:57:30.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,大多只能在好莱坞看到 而且也不是很多作品都有
Dialogue: 1,2:57:30.56,2:57:35.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后你逃出了一众感染者 遇到了老朋友海尔格
Dialogue: 1,2:57:35.09,2:57:37.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,她正在攻击落单的勒弗
Dialogue: 1,2:57:37.25,2:57:41.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,你和她有一段快速的肉搏战 最后你终于一个大锤80让她……
Dialogue: 1,2:57:41.93,2:57:43.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,……破相了
Dialogue: 1,2:57:43.56,2:57:45.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比也把装备拿了回来
Dialogue: 1,2:57:45.16,2:57:50.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为海尔格刚好在抓走埃比之后把她的包背在了自己身上
Dialogue: 1,2:57:50.33,2:57:52.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这样的设定还是挺有趣的
Dialogue: 1,2:57:52.34,2:57:56.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为类似这样的游戏 在角色被绑架后想找回装备
Dialogue: 1,2:57:56.67,2:58:00.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,而装备通常只是放在某个箱子里或者桌子上
Dialogue: 1,2:58:00.35,2:58:03.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在三人之间进行了一段关于赛拉菲特帮和WLF的对话
Dialogue: 1,2:58:03.72,2:58:06.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,看他们能互相信任还是挺奇怪的
Dialogue: 1,2:58:06.14,2:58:10.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在这个节骨眼上 他们都互相救了对方
Dialogue: 1,2:58:10.19,2:58:12.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以还是稍微能理解的
Dialogue: 1,2:58:12.29,2:58:18.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比刚刚从海尔格手里救下了勒弗 勒弗也救下了要被吊死的埃比
Dialogue: 1,2:58:18.65,2:58:23.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这种一报还一报的情节的存在促使两人结成了血盟关系
Dialogue: 1,2:58:23.21,2:58:26.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比最后还直截了当地问了勒弗怎么回事
Dialogue: 1,2:58:37.42,2:58:39.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,而勒弗的回答其实很真诚
Dialogue: 1,2:58:39.59,2:58:41.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,但背后的具体内容远比看起来得复杂
Dialogue: 1,2:58:41.96,2:58:44.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过不着急 我们会聊到这部分的
Dialogue: 1,2:58:44.24,2:58:50.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,你和你新小队又杀了几波感染者 慢慢开始相互信任起来
Dialogue: 1,2:58:50.87,2:58:55.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,剧情在埃比抱起雅拉 让勒弗看好四周的时候达到了高潮
Dialogue: 1,2:58:55.82,2:58:59.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们一起来到了一个拖车小屋 打算过夜
Dialogue: 1,2:58:59.57,2:59:02.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比出于关心 帮雅拉简单看了一下胳膊
Dialogue: 1,2:59:02.57,2:59:05.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,明显看着挺严重的
Dialogue: 1,2:59:05.92,2:59:08.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,简单打理好后 埃比离开了
Dialogue: 1,2:59:08.45,2:59:12.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,她救了一个疤脸帮 她和他们一样感到了纠结
Dialogue: 1,2:59:12.89,2:59:16.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,而作为另一个游戏角色之间的类比
Dialogue: 1,2:59:16.07,2:59:20.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比发现她自己变成了另一个欧文
Dialogue: 1,2:59:20.57,2:59:23.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,她帮助了一名疤脸帮
Dialogue: 1,2:59:23.36,2:59:27.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这在WLF里可是大忌
Dialogue: 1,2:59:27.50,2:59:30.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,这将完全改变接下来的情节
Dialogue: 1,2:59:30.53,2:59:32.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们马上就会看到
Dialogue: 1,2:59:32.12,2:59:36.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比走的时候 内心的纠结是可想而知的
Dialogue: 1,2:59:36.17,2:59:40.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,她关心这两个孩子 但她自己却不知道为什么
Dialogue: 1,2:59:40.25,2:59:44.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种感觉就像玩家现在对埃比的情感一样
Dialogue: 1,2:59:44.45,2:59:47.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏这样的安排真是太妙了
Dialogue: 1,2:59:47.96,2:59:52.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和玩家有相同的困惑与内心的矛盾
Dialogue: 1,2:59:52.10,2:59:58.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比是因自己竟然会同情对面阵营的两个敌人而困扰
Dialogue: 1,2:59:58.10,3:00:04.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我们玩家 则是因为我们想去恨杀死乔尔的埃比而感觉到矛盾
Dialogue: 1,3:00:04.56,3:00:06.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能我们中还有一些人仍增恨埃比
Dialogue: 1,3:00:06.56,3:00:10.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我们至少已经慢慢开始同情她 甚至开始关心她了
Dialogue: 1,3:00:10.94,3:00:12.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的处理真的很棒
Dialogue: 1,3:00:12.56,3:00:16.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,正是这样精妙的故事安排才成就了这样一款游戏
Dialogue: 1,3:00:16.87,3:00:23.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,也因此 我认为虽然游戏有节奏上的问题 但我还是建议大家能够认真通关
Dialogue: 1,3:00:23.61,3:00:27.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后 埃比在船厂解决了一大堆的感染者
Dialogue: 1,3:00:27.38,3:00:30.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,来到了一些停泊于此的船上
Dialogue: 1,3:00:30.71,3:00:35.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,你又杀了一堆感染者 最后拿到了十字弓
Dialogue: 1,3:00:35.69,3:00:38.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是整个游戏里我最喜欢的武器
Dialogue: 1,3:00:38.51,3:00:42.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,解决掉所有感染者后 你来到了欧文所在的水族馆
Dialogue: 1,3:00:42.68,3:00:45.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,但你到处都找不到欧文
Dialogue: 1,3:00:45.59,3:00:50.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比有点担心 怕他死了 或者被抛弃后决定离开自己的岗位
Dialogue: 1,3:00:50.99,3:00:53.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,但最终埃比还是找到了他
Dialogue: 1,3:00:53.18,3:00:56.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,他坐在船上 正在修上面的冰箱
Dialogue: 1,3:00:56.66,3:01:00.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,这条船看起来是他在世界上唯一安全的小空间了
Dialogue: 1,3:01:00.35,3:01:03.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后埃比和欧文开始对话
Dialogue: 1,3:01:03.03,3:01:07.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们懂的……这段不太好解释……
Dialogue: 1,3:01:07.94,3:01:10.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就直接播片了……
Dialogue: 1,3:05:17.78,3:05:21.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,好耶！18+！18+！好耶！
Dialogue: 1,3:05:21.56,3:05:23.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,我完全没料到会是这样的发展
Dialogue: 1,3:05:23.60,3:05:26.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且说实话我也完全不知道该说什么
Dialogue: 1,3:05:26.33,3:05:31.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,就感觉挺突然的……明明都要打起来了 怎么就突然开始……热身运动了
Dialogue: 1,3:05:31.43,3:05:34.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真不……彳亍口巴……你们开心就好
Dialogue: 1,3:05:34.31,3:05:37.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,感觉有很多发自肺腑的真情实感在流露出来
Dialogue: 1,3:05:37.67,3:05:41.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我感觉这些都是毫无根据的
Dialogue: 1,3:05:41.50,3:05:45.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也不明白 如果有什么深度的文学原因 请告诉我 谢谢
Dialogue: 1,3:05:45.86,3:05:50.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也不知道自己想没想过这些 但我反正是不知该如何评价
Dialogue: 1,3:05:50.57,3:05:52.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以……我们继续
Dialogue: 1,3:05:52.50,3:05:58.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,在「西雅图 第1天」结尾 埃比做噩梦了 梦见她在自己父亲去世的医院房间里
Dialogue: 1,3:05:58.84,3:06:02.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,看到雅拉和勒弗被吊死
Dialogue: 1,3:06:02.93,3:06:08.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 这似乎意味着她对他们有某种家人般的情感
Dialogue: 1,3:06:08.33,3:06:13.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为在埃比的梦中 他们死在了和父亲一样的地方
Dialogue: 1,3:06:13.31,3:06:19.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得一定不能低估她在这样的一个地方梦见他们的意义
Dialogue: 1,3:06:19.22,3:06:22.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果她单纯因为担心他们遇害而感到压力
Dialogue: 1,3:06:22.31,3:06:28.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,那她大可只梦见回WLF基地的路上看到了他们的尸体
Dialogue: 1,3:06:28.85,3:06:32.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以她这样的梦境发生在那所医院内是非常重要的
Dialogue: 1,3:06:32.90,3:06:38.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这体现出她自己有着超乎自己想象的 与这两个孩子的情感上的联系
Dialogue: 1,3:06:38.63,3:06:44.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这样的梦过后 她决定亲自回去看看 确保他们还安全
Dialogue: 1,3:06:44.12,3:06:47.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 她正式决定要去帮助那两个疤脸帮了
Dialogue: 1,3:06:47.95,3:06:52.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像其他WLF士兵一样困惑
Dialogue: 1,3:06:52.88,3:06:58.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,她似乎也发现 之前欧文在这样的场景也是同样的感受
Dialogue: 1,3:06:58.49,3:07:00.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,她也干腻了
Dialogue: 1,3:07:00.83,3:07:02.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,「西雅图 第2天」
Dialogue: 1,3:07:02.81,3:07:05.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比一醒来就回到了船厂的方向
Dialogue: 1,3:07:05.84,3:07:07.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,想要找到雅拉和勒弗
Dialogue: 1,3:07:07.76,3:07:11.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,她遇到了大量的疤脸帮 其中还有几个野蛮人
Dialogue: 1,3:07:11.00,3:07:13.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,让战斗更加有趣
Dialogue: 1,3:07:13.91,3:07:16.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,解决掉他们后 埃比回到了拖车上小屋
Dialogue: 1,3:07:16.82,3:07:20.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,发现雅拉的状况真的很糟糕
Dialogue: 1,3:07:20.15,3:07:22.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,她的胳膊肿的像猴屁股一样
Dialogue: 1,3:07:22.31,3:07:27.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,很明显她需要一些……就说是“非常严重的治疗”吧
Dialogue: 1,3:07:27.11,3:07:32.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比抱起雅拉 把她带回水族馆 勒弗一路跟随
Dialogue: 1,3:07:32.78,3:07:38.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,她的计划基本上是让梅尔尽一切手段治疗雅拉的手臂
Dialogue: 1,3:07:38.33,3:07:41.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用说也知道 这是一场豪赌
Dialogue: 1,3:07:41.30,3:07:46.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为埃比相当于出卖了伊萨克和其他WLF成员
Dialogue: 1,3:07:46.97,3:07:52.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,她最终很有可能会完全被组织排斥在外
Dialogue: 1,3:07:52.16,3:07:55.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者因为帮助敌人而直接被处决
Dialogue: 1,3:07:55.49,3:07:59.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然 你可以说这俩人是前疤脸帮成员
Dialogue: 1,3:07:59.88,3:08:03.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们背叛了疤脸帮 所以帮助他们也没什么问题
Dialogue: 1,3:08:03.53,3:08:05.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我感觉这点并不重要
Dialogue: 1,3:08:05.24,3:08:10.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,通常情况下 敌人的敌人就是朋友
Dialogue: 1,3:08:10.10,3:08:14.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,但在这个例子里 敌人的敌人还真不是你的朋友
Dialogue: 1,3:08:14.60,3:08:17.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们都是你应该杀死的敌人罢了
Dialogue: 1,3:08:17.56,3:08:24.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为在这样一个末世 人们没工夫考虑那些复杂的道德与伦理难题
Dialogue: 1,3:08:24.11,3:08:28.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 梅尔在初次见面没被吓到过后
Dialogue: 1,3:08:28.04,3:08:35.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,诊断说是粉末性骨折 想活命就必须截肢
Dialogue: 1,3:08:35.39,3:08:38.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,随后梅尔列出了手术需要的工具列表
Dialogue: 1,3:08:38.39,3:08:44.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,欧文说为啥不直接一刀下去然后用火药烧一下伤口呢
Dialogue: 1,3:08:44.39,3:08:47.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这样很容易导致感染
Dialogue: 1,3:08:47.63,3:08:50.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们要帮人帮到底 送佛送到西
Dialogue: 1,3:08:50.30,3:08:53.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以梅尔说她需要一些手术器具
Dialogue: 1,3:08:53.54,3:08:56.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比说她可以回医院拿
Dialogue: 1,3:08:56.18,3:09:00.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,问题是按照WLF从水族馆到医院的正常路线
Dialogue: 1,3:09:00.77,3:09:07.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,单程就要一天 来回需要两天 雅拉根本等不了那么久
Dialogue: 1,3:09:07.19,3:09:12.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这时勒弗提出他们可以走疤脸帮用的“桥”
Dialogue: 1,3:09:12.12,3:09:14.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样就能在城市的楼顶上方穿行了
Dialogue: 1,3:09:14.36,3:09:18.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,目前大家还不清楚具体是什么样的桥
Dialogue: 1,3:09:19.01,3:09:23.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外 让我感觉有点奇怪的是 欧文和埃比这样的WLF成员
Dialogue: 1,3:09:23.36,3:09:27.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,竟然对他们所谓的“桥”毫不知情
Dialogue: 1,3:09:27.50,3:09:31.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,WLF的确知道疤脸帮能在城市里非常快速地移动
Dialogue: 1,3:09:31.11,3:09:34.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,快到让人感觉像变魔术
Dialogue: 1,3:09:34.42,3:09:36.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,但显然他们从来就没想过
Dialogue: 1,3:09:36.33,3:09:41.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,疤脸帮可能会利用房顶上的桥来在城市里旅行
Dialogue: 1,3:09:41.69,3:09:46.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,勒弗说可以带他们去疤脸帮的桥梁系统
Dialogue: 1,3:09:46.52,3:09:48.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,他非常熟悉路线
Dialogue: 1,3:09:48.77,3:09:54.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,并说按照他们的路线大概能在两小时内就能到达医院
Dialogue: 1,3:09:54.83,3:09:58.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比没有过多犹豫 直接就出发了
Dialogue: 1,3:09:58.45,3:10:02.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们出门的时候 欧文拦下了埃比 想要和她谈谈
Dialogue: 1,3:10:02.12,3:10:07.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她一点也不想聊昨晚的激情一夜
Dialogue: 1,3:10:07.49,3:10:11.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为她好像找到了自己新的家庭上的归属
Dialogue: 1,3:10:11.18,3:10:14.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们看到她真的放下欧文了
Dialogue: 1,3:10:14.48,3:10:18.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且行为上也不那么依赖他
Dialogue: 1,3:10:18.71,3:10:20.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,给人一种刮目相看的感觉
Dialogue: 1,3:10:20.39,3:10:23.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,在此之前埃比很明显还对欧文有感情
Dialogue: 1,3:10:23.81,3:10:30.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使是序章里我们第一次见到埃比和欧文鸟瞰雪中的杰克逊小镇时
Dialogue: 1,3:10:30.41,3:10:35.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们可能已经感觉到埃比和欧文两人间弥漫的奇怪的紧张情绪
Dialogue: 1,3:10:35.18,3:10:39.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比在她父亲去世后从来就没和欧文真正走到一起去过
Dialogue: 1,3:10:39.32,3:10:43.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且显然 乔尔死了以后也没什么改变
Dialogue: 1,3:10:43.85,3:10:48.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以欧文开始粘着梅尔 即使这俩人也不怎么对付
Dialogue: 1,3:10:48.40,3:10:51.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至看起来彼此不那么喜欢对方
Dialogue: 1,3:10:51.41,3:10:54.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不能完全确定这是否是故意安排的
Dialogue: 1,3:10:54.02,3:11:00.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对我来说欧文和梅尔之间完全没有化学反应是肯定的
Dialogue: 1,3:11:00.32,3:11:05.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果编剧想让玩家感觉到俩人有感情 那以顽皮狗的实力肯定是能做到的
Dialogue: 1,3:11:05.00,3:11:06.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果编剧想让玩家感觉到俩人有感情 那以顽皮狗的实力肯定是能做到的
Dialogue: 1,3:11:06.65,3:11:11.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以要么是演员的完美表演和编剧的刻意安排
Dialogue: 1,3:11:11.80,3:11:17.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,让角色们看起来就是没有共同点 就是聊不到一起去
Dialogue: 1,3:11:17.90,3:11:21.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人之间就是有很深的紧张情绪在里面发酵
Dialogue: 1,3:11:21.89,3:11:25.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,要么就完全是游戏制作上和编剧策划上的失误
Dialogue: 1,3:11:25.94,3:11:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,要么就完全是游戏制作上和编剧策划上的失误
Dialogue: 1,3:11:28.22,3:11:30.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人倾向于前一种
Dialogue: 1,3:11:30.11,3:11:34.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为梅尔和欧文就是要给人一种怪怪的感觉
Dialogue: 1,3:11:34.97,3:11:38.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,队伍里其他人看起来都知道他们两人之间奇怪的氛围
Dialogue: 1,3:11:38.93,3:11:42.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时欧文和埃比看起来互相对对方有感觉
Dialogue: 1,3:11:42.56,3:11:44.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但玩家却不明白为何俩人没走到一起
Dialogue: 1,3:11:44.90,3:11:49.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这种紧张的情绪总会得到解决……等就好了
Dialogue: 1,3:11:49.68,3:11:52.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,离开水族馆后 埃比和勒弗要前往一座大楼 爬到顶端
Dialogue: 1,3:11:52.63,3:11:54.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,离开水族馆后 埃比和勒弗要前往一座大楼 爬到顶端
Dialogue: 1,3:11:54.71,3:11:57.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,才能登上勒弗之前说的“桥”
Dialogue: 1,3:11:57.68,3:12:02.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的老高了 而且刚好顶端还被云雾挡住了
Dialogue: 1,3:12:02.81,3:12:07.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的安排真的很巧妙 提升了这种场景下的紧张感
Dialogue: 1,3:12:07.61,3:12:13.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这还是没有解释为什么WLF至今都没发现这座“桥”
Dialogue: 1,3:12:13.11,3:12:17.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为西雅图总不可能天天都云雾缭绕的吧
Dialogue: 1,3:12:17.09,3:12:20.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,总不能天天都看不见高楼大厦的楼顶
Dialogue: 1,3:12:20.36,3:12:24.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,肯定会有人在天晴的时候看到楼顶有桥
Dialogue: 1,3:12:24.35,3:12:29.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 WLF觉得没有必要去探索这种
Dialogue: 1,3:12:29.71,3:12:35.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,几乎能完美沟通几座摩天大楼的桥梁系统是很奇怪的
Dialogue: 1,3:12:35.48,3:12:38.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其是在地面上你都能看到
Dialogue: 1,3:12:38.27,3:12:40.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,但或许只有我会这么较真吧
Dialogue: 1,3:12:40.25,3:12:43.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 埃比和勒弗一点点向那座高楼推进
Dialogue: 1,3:12:43.79,3:12:47.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,爬上几栋建筑 探索了很多区域
Dialogue: 1,3:12:47.51,3:12:50.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,还聊了很多有趣的东西
Dialogue: 1,3:12:50.57,3:12:53.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,没什么特别的事情 多数都是有一搭没一搭地闲聊
Dialogue: 1,3:12:53.87,3:12:57.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,但主要是为了表现他们两人彼此越来越融洽
Dialogue: 1,3:12:57.92,3:13:01.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,我最喜欢的时刻是偶然进到某间公寓里
Dialogue: 1,3:13:01.13,3:13:03.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,公寓主人显然很喜欢玩游戏
Dialogue: 1,3:13:03.95,3:13:06.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,桌面上甚至摆着《龙与地下城》的桌游
Dialogue: 1,3:13:06.60,3:13:09.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,家里还摆着PlayStation的游戏机之类的设备
Dialogue: 1,3:13:09.95,3:13:11.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,感觉挺酷的
Dialogue: 1,3:13:11.09,3:13:16.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人认为这样的房子很可能就是根据某个开发者自己家建模的
Dialogue: 1,3:13:16.55,3:13:21.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,我的确听说过贝塞斯达和洛克斯代迪做过类似的事情
Dialogue: 1,3:13:21.76,3:13:25.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们把自家员工的工作环境建模成游戏里的场景
Dialogue: 1,3:13:25.40,3:13:27.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟 这就是他们身边的事物
Dialogue: 1,3:13:27.20,3:13:30.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是游戏这个虚拟世界中来自真实世界的影子
Dialogue: 1,3:13:30.83,3:13:33.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这太酷了
Dialogue: 1,3:13:33.02,3:13:38.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我觉得这个房间的细节也很丰富
Dialogue: 1,3:13:38.15,3:13:40.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人继续穿过很多建筑
Dialogue: 1,3:13:40.64,3:13:42.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,越过一些急流
Dialogue: 1,3:13:42.65,3:13:46.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,来到了目标大楼旁边的一处建筑工地
Dialogue: 1,3:13:46.70,3:13:48.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个建筑工地是我认为整个游戏里最有趣的战斗场景之一
Dialogue: 1,3:13:48.87,3:13:52.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个建筑工地是我认为整个游戏里最有趣的战斗场景之一
Dialogue: 1,3:13:52.64,3:13:57.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,有大范围的垂直空间 到处都有赛拉菲特帮
Dialogue: 1,3:13:57.40,3:14:00.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,有野蛮人 有些拿近战武器
Dialogue: 1,3:14:00.53,3:14:02.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,还有些拿远程武器的
Dialogue: 1,3:14:02.87,3:14:06.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,在较高难度下这些敌人的布局真的很有意思
Dialogue: 1,3:14:06.32,3:14:09.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,我承认我玩的时候可被整惨了
Dialogue: 1,3:14:09.47,3:14:11.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,但重要的是 游戏这里仍然感觉很平衡
Dialogue: 1,3:14:11.96,3:14:17.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,我没有感觉游戏在故意刁难人 或者说是在轻视玩家
Dialogue: 1,3:14:17.16,3:14:21.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,没有搞什么无脑设计的那种比如能穿墙的逆天boss
Dialogue: 1,3:14:21.29,3:14:23.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段关卡平衡做的很好
Dialogue: 1,3:14:23.18,3:14:28.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,这给人的感觉单纯是局面很困难 需要两人的配合
Dialogue: 1,3:14:28.22,3:14:30.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,而俩人的配合上道了 事情就简单了
Dialogue: 1,3:14:30.47,3:14:32.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,清空这部分区域后
Dialogue: 1,3:14:32.45,3:14:37.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人登上工地用的电梯 送他们直接到大楼的顶端然后上桥
Dialogue: 1,3:14:37.85,3:14:41.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果大家还记得的话 其实埃比特别恐高
Dialogue: 1,3:14:41.83,3:14:46.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这里勒弗还给她分享了一下忘掉恐惧的小建议
Dialogue: 1,3:14:46.86,3:14:50.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,让她能把注意力从位置变高带来的恐惧中转移出来
Dialogue: 1,3:15:29.09,3:15:32.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,来到大楼顶端 他们开始过桥了
Dialogue: 1,3:15:32.18,3:15:35.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,而“桥”实际上只是一个倒塌的起重机
Dialogue: 1,3:15:35.60,3:15:41.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,这还是证明了WLF应该是可以在晴天看到这架起重机的
Dialogue: 1,3:15:41.67,3:15:44.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,这足以让他们发现点什么 让他们去调查了
Dialogue: 1,3:15:44.15,3:15:46.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至可以霸占为己有
Dialogue: 1,3:15:46.10,3:15:50.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许有一句话或其他东西提到了为什么WLF没有使用这座桥
Dialogue: 1,3:15:50.69,3:15:55.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我只是错过了 或者我在写脚本时想不起来或忘了
Dialogue: 1,3:15:55.58,3:15:58.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之如果有什么漏掉的 请告诉我
Dialogue: 1,3:15:58.19,3:16:03.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在大家都能猜到 埃比过桥的时候人都吓懵了
Dialogue: 1,3:16:03.44,3:16:07.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且说实话 这地方谁来谁都得腿软
Dialogue: 1,3:16:07.73,3:16:10.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这已经不是恐不恐高的问题了
Dialogue: 1,3:16:10.10,3:16:17.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比这时候被吓成这个德行也说明了她过这座桥有多么艰难
Dialogue: 1,3:16:17.78,3:16:20.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且实际上在过这座临时桥的时候
Dialogue: 1,3:16:20.63,3:16:24.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,勒弗讲出了全游戏最搞笑的一句话
Dialogue: 1,3:16:24.65,3:16:28.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少我感觉太逗了 因为这句就这么凭空冒出来
Dialogue: 1,3:16:36.99,3:16:38.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,哈哈哈 可太逗了
Dialogue: 1,3:16:38.41,3:16:40.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,过完第一作桥后
Dialogue: 1,3:16:40.00,3:16:43.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,似乎他们终于通过了最困难的部分
Dialogue: 1,3:16:43.12,3:16:44.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,但……并没有
Dialogue: 1,3:16:52.57,3:16:54.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这可能是少数我能记起的
Dialogue: 1,3:16:54.68,3:16:58.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,被游戏的背景设定深深惊到的地方了
Dialogue: 1,3:16:58.36,3:17:03.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,整座桥是那么优美 又危机四伏
Dialogue: 1,3:17:03.34,3:17:06.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,远处的医院又是那么催人向前 令人振奋
Dialogue: 1,3:17:06.40,3:17:11.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,还能非常好地告诉玩家他们在西雅图的什么地方
Dialogue: 1,3:17:11.29,3:17:13.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是要说一个令人失望的点
Dialogue: 1,3:17:13.40,3:17:17.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是我第一次玩的时候发现远处模型贴图会出现Z-fighting的问题
Dialogue: 1,3:17:17.20,3:17:19.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还算能接受
Dialogue: 1,3:17:19.09,3:17:22.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗这种秀贴图狂魔会出现这样的图像bug实在少见
Dialogue: 1,3:17:22.54,3:17:23.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就不追究了
Dialogue: 1,3:17:23.89,3:17:26.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,而事实就是如此 埃比跨越了这座桥
Dialogue: 1,3:17:26.96,3:17:29.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,她在勒弗的帮助下战胜了恐惧
Dialogue: 1,3:17:29.76,3:17:33.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,她完成了自己以为不可能完成的任务
Dialogue: 1,3:17:33.94,3:17:36.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,成功跨越了这座巨大的……
Dialogue: 1,3:17:36.43,3:17:37.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,我勒个去她摔下来了！
Dialogue: 1,3:18:02.62,3:18:04.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 她……掉下来了
Dialogue: 1,3:18:04.74,3:18:06.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,还好下面有个楼顶泳池
Dialogue: 1,3:18:06.42,3:18:08.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在两人决定
Dialogue: 1,3:18:08.48,3:18:11.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,想办法到达大楼的底层
Dialogue: 1,3:18:11.52,3:18:15.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,等到了地面 他们就能直奔医院了
Dialogue: 1,3:18:15.78,3:18:20.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,在下楼过程中 你要面对大量的感染者
Dialogue: 1,3:18:20.59,3:18:26.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比还会在这里找到喷火器 可能是游戏里最好用的范围武器
Dialogue: 1,3:18:26.20,3:18:27.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为它喷射范围广
Dialogue: 1,3:18:27.97,3:18:31.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,很容易用来处理大量的人群和感染者
Dialogue: 1,3:18:31.90,3:18:34.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我不得不说这玩意燃料太稀缺了
Dialogue: 1,3:18:34.09,3:18:39.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,很难长时间持续使用
Dialogue: 1,3:18:39.04,3:18:41.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外 我感觉这座大楼的关卡让我很兴奋
Dialogue: 1,3:18:41.92,3:18:48.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,我本来以为这样的环境是设计包含垂直空间的战斗的大好机会
Dialogue: 1,3:18:48.10,3:18:53.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,有些平台可能还会有一些用到绳索的元素
Dialogue: 1,3:18:53.38,3:18:55.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,但其实这些内容真的不多
Dialogue: 1,3:18:55.30,3:18:58.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家其实单纯是在找路下楼 仅此而已
Dialogue: 1,3:18:58.30,3:19:03.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,在杀了几波感染者之后 总感觉这样大好机会就错过了
Dialogue: 1,3:19:03.25,3:19:06.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之 他们成功回到地面 出来后发现就在医院旁边
Dialogue: 1,3:19:06.94,3:19:11.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这也正是艾莉来到医院后到达的相同区域
Dialogue: 1,3:19:11.18,3:19:14.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者应该说是埃比先来 艾莉后来的
Dialogue: 1,3:19:14.44,3:19:20.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,借着这个机会 我们可以聊聊游戏里大量使用重复区域这件事
Dialogue: 1,3:19:20.05,3:19:22.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人批评过这一点
Dialogue: 1,3:19:22.42,3:19:27.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们认为顽皮狗只是在用不同角色重复使用相同的地图关卡
Dialogue: 1,3:19:27.46,3:19:30.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这个例子里就是埃比和艾莉
Dialogue: 1,3:19:30.61,3:19:35.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得单纯因为顽皮狗复用了关卡就批评他们是不公平的
Dialogue: 1,3:19:35.26,3:19:39.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 游戏里的一个关卡至少应该是
Dialogue: 1,3:19:39.97,3:19:43.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,一组不同物品的集合、一种布局的地图
Dialogue: 1,3:19:43.08,3:19:46.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及一般来讲的各种可能性的组合
Dialogue: 1,3:19:46.33,3:19:51.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家可以做很多不同的事情来与这个关卡进行互动
Dialogue: 1,3:19:51.43,3:19:54.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,一个简单的关卡可能就是一个带门的房间
Dialogue: 1,3:19:54.52,3:19:59.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,你走向门 开门 出去 你就完成这个关卡了
Dialogue: 1,3:19:59.08,3:20:04.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但一个复杂的关卡可以有一个很复杂的目标
Dialogue: 1,3:20:04.06,3:20:07.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如活着离开这片区域
Dialogue: 1,3:20:07.53,3:20:11.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后制作者再让实现这个目标的过程复杂化
Dialogue: 1,3:20:11.17,3:20:16.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如引入许多不同的敌人 你必须解决他们才行
Dialogue: 1,3:20:16.33,3:20:20.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者甚至设计一个谜题 你必须解决它 打开这扇门才行
Dialogue: 1,3:20:20.29,3:20:23.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是你如何把一个关卡从走过一扇门这样简单的事情
Dialogue: 1,3:20:23.94,3:20:26.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,变成更复杂、吸引玩家的事情
Dialogue: 1,3:20:26.83,3:20:27.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此
Dialogue: 1,3:20:27.55,3:20:32.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为说顽皮狗在这里完全是在复用关卡是不公平的
Dialogue: 1,3:20:32.65,3:20:38.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为埃比和艾莉是在用完全不同的方式与这个关卡进行互动
Dialogue: 1,3:20:38.71,3:20:42.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比走进医院最终找到诺拉的过程中
Dialogue: 1,3:20:42.52,3:20:45.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,她并没有这这些人进行战斗
Dialogue: 1,3:20:45.64,3:20:47.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,她不会向他们开枪
Dialogue: 1,3:20:47.08,3:20:50.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,不会向他们扔炸弹 扔燃烧瓶
Dialogue: 1,3:20:50.20,3:20:52.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,她只是路过 和路人们唠嗑
Dialogue: 1,3:20:52.42,3:20:56.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,更不用说你还进了医院 看到了很多艾莉没看到的地方
Dialogue: 1,3:20:56.62,3:20:59.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,拿这和艾莉在这部分的关卡相比的话
Dialogue: 1,3:20:59.35,3:21:01.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,区别大了去了
Dialogue: 1,3:21:01.25,3:21:05.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你的观点是 制作者在游戏开发上走捷径
Dialogue: 1,3:21:05.95,3:21:10.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们把这些角色放在相同的关卡场景内 然后以这种方式安排故事
Dialogue: 1,3:21:10.84,3:21:14.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我觉得这样的观点是合理的
Dialogue: 1,3:21:14.89,3:21:20.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果这个场景在故事中是有意义的 或者安排的故事是有意义的
Dialogue: 1,3:21:20.64,3:21:24.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,那我不觉得重复使用一个关卡有什么原则上的问题
Dialogue: 1,3:21:24.54,3:21:29.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为一个高质量的游戏完全可以把所有场景设置在几条走廊这样小的地方
Dialogue: 1,3:21:29.86,3:21:33.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如《P.T.》这款游戏 它只是一款试玩版游戏
Dialogue: 1,3:21:33.70,3:21:36.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,但却能获得如此巨大的成功
Dialogue: 1,3:21:36.85,3:21:43.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,而它所有的场景只有两条走廊 一个里屋 一个浴室
Dialogue: 1,3:21:43.65,3:21:47.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,它全部内容就这些 但它的品质却是惊人的高
Dialogue: 1,3:21:47.17,3:21:49.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可以找一些简单的东西
Dialogue: 1,3:21:49.41,3:21:53.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如一个模型在整个游戏里用了多少次
Dialogue: 1,3:21:53.11,3:21:57.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者根据游戏如何使用这些资源来论证你的观点
Dialogue: 1,3:21:57.76,3:22:01.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为后者听上去更合情合理一些
Dialogue: 1,3:22:01.78,3:22:03.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我扯远了
Dialogue: 1,3:22:03.19,3:22:06.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比自己进了医院 留下勒弗在外面等着
Dialogue: 1,3:22:06.41,3:22:12.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,原因很显然 要是有人在医院附近看到勒弗 那咱谁也甭想活了
Dialogue: 1,3:22:12.55,3:22:15.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和WLF的成员很聊得来
Dialogue: 1,3:22:15.43,3:22:20.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但大家发现埃比违抗了伊萨克的命令只是时间问题
Dialogue: 1,3:22:20.29,3:22:23.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得埃比自己是清楚的 所以她在这关才表现得如此着急
Dialogue: 1,3:22:23.74,3:22:26.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,想赶紧找到所需物资然后马上跑路
Dialogue: 1,3:22:26.62,3:22:30.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,我的意思是 当然还有一部分原因是她要救的那个女孩
Dialogue: 1,3:22:30.56,3:22:33.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在还在鬼门关呢 这可能对她也有鼓励
Dialogue: 1,3:22:33.64,3:22:37.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,让她想动作快点 但……你们懂的
Dialogue: 1,3:22:37.01,3:22:40.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,你进入医院 和几个人聊天 然后……哎呦这不巧了吗！
Dialogue: 1,3:22:40.63,3:22:45.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不是之前艾莉捅死的玩PSV摸鱼的女孩吗？
Dialogue: 1,3:22:45.03,3:22:50.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者应该叫“之后”？因为她现在还活着 这可真……真奇妙
Dialogue: 1,3:22:50.24,3:22:53.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比进医院没蹦跶多久
Dialogue: 1,3:22:53.06,3:22:58.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,有人向伊萨克报告后埃比就被人发现她从昨天开始一直在擅离职守
Dialogue: 1,3:22:58.57,3:23:01.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以她就被锁在电梯栏杆上了
Dialogue: 1,3:23:01.21,3:23:06.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,她基本上会一直被关到所有人把东西搬回前线基地以后
Dialogue: 1,3:23:06.85,3:23:08.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,到时候伊萨克再来处理她的事
Dialogue: 1,3:23:08.09,3:23:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,又是这件多次被提及的事情
Dialogue: 1,3:23:10.53,3:23:14.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,不止埃比听到过 艾莉也听说WLF有事情要发生
Dialogue: 1,3:23:14.86,3:23:17.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们在把所有物资运往前线基地
Dialogue: 1,3:23:17.86,3:23:22.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们还集结了所有的WLF士兵也前往前线基地
Dialogue: 1,3:23:22.51,3:23:26.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,感觉要发生什么事了 伊萨克在动员所有人
Dialogue: 1,3:23:26.58,3:23:28.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,大的要来了
Dialogue: 1,3:23:28.09,3:23:33.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,伊萨克之前提到要对赛拉菲特岛屿发起总攻
Dialogue: 1,3:23:33.56,3:23:36.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,让这场战争做个了结
Dialogue: 1,3:23:36.34,3:23:43.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不是个小事 因为这显然会牺牲成百上千条生命
Dialogue: 1,3:23:43.27,3:23:46.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,我甚至能想象到在另一个平行世界里
Dialogue: 1,3:23:46.39,3:23:51.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比到这里没有继续为雅拉寻找救命的材料
Dialogue: 1,3:23:51.22,3:23:56.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是决定去阻止这次侵略行动 拯救无数在这场战争中丧命的
Dialogue: 1,3:23:56.35,3:24:00.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,赛拉菲特帮和WLF士兵的生命
Dialogue: 1,3:24:00.34,3:24:04.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我明白当前的剧情可能更有亲和力
Dialogue: 1,3:24:04.27,3:24:08.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是当玩家能在情感上与一个角色产生联系的时候
Dialogue: 1,3:24:08.86,3:24:12.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这个例子里是雅拉 在另一个例子里是勒弗
Dialogue: 1,3:24:12.70,3:24:16.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,相比于让玩家在情感上与WLF或赛拉菲特那样的邪教产生联系
Dialogue: 1,3:24:16.13,3:24:19.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,相比于让玩家在情感上与WLF或赛拉菲特那样的邪教产生联系
Dialogue: 1,3:24:19.80,3:24:23.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的安排能让编剧有更好的发挥空间
Dialogue: 1,3:24:23.80,3:24:27.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,在埃比被锁在电梯栏杆上时 诺拉刚好经过
Dialogue: 1,3:24:27.78,3:24:30.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,她来的正是时候 把埃比放了
Dialogue: 1,3:24:30.43,3:24:36.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是之前艾莉爬通风管道的时候她与WLF成员发生小冲突的时候
Dialogue: 1,3:24:36.10,3:24:40.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们认为是诺拉把埃比放走的 因为的确是她干的
Dialogue: 1,3:24:40.37,3:24:45.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真的感觉站在另一个视角明白一切发生了什么是一件很酷的事情
Dialogue: 1,3:24:45.79,3:24:52.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然 玩家不需要知道一切就能有很好的游戏体验或叙事体验
Dialogue: 1,3:24:52.75,3:24:57.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多小说中的故事都没有完全解释到底发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,3:24:57.64,3:25:02.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,它们只是可以选择留白 给读者无限的想象空间
Dialogue: 1,3:25:02.08,3:25:05.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而在TLOU2里 一切都是深思熟虑的
Dialogue: 1,3:25:05.11,3:25:10.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少在某种程度上 你能够以这种新的视角回到过去
Dialogue: 1,3:25:10.33,3:25:15.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,了解更多东西 弄清楚为什么这些角色当时会这样做
Dialogue: 1,3:25:15.28,3:25:20.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,WLF不是为了游戏故事方便才一拍脑门决定把物资转移到别的地方
Dialogue: 1,3:25:20.80,3:25:24.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是背后有一个宏大的侵略计划
Dialogue: 1,3:25:24.22,3:25:28.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使伊萨克的这个侵略与艾莉完全无关
Dialogue: 1,3:25:28.00,3:25:33.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使就算艾莉的故事结束她也不知道有这样一回事
Dialogue: 1,3:25:33.43,3:25:38.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 诺拉领埃比去地下室收集雅拉胳膊手术需要的东西
Dialogue: 1,3:25:38.26,3:25:42.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,她不知道埃比在帮谁 也不知道她为什么需要这些东西
Dialogue: 1,3:25:42.46,3:25:45.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她知道这些手术器具
Dialogue: 1,3:25:45.45,3:25:49.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,很可能会用来救死扶伤
Dialogue: 1,3:25:49.93,3:25:54.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,她还知道医院里其他地方所有物资都已经被清理走了
Dialogue: 1,3:25:54.96,3:25:58.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,全都按照伊萨克的要求送到前线基地去了
Dialogue: 1,3:25:58.33,3:26:02.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比还能搜刮这些东西的地方只剩没清理的地下室了
Dialogue: 1,3:26:02.89,3:26:09.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,问题是 疫情最初在2013年爆发的那一天
Dialogue: 1,3:26:09.79,3:26:12.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人都涌入了医院
Dialogue: 1,3:26:12.08,3:26:17.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 当时在医院院内肯定会有相当大规模的传染
Dialogue: 1,3:26:17.22,3:26:20.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,直到最后整个医院都被隔离
Dialogue: 1,3:26:20.02,3:26:25.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,锁上所有门 破坏掉所有楼梯 让感染者都上不来
Dialogue: 1,3:26:25.75,3:26:28.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,把它们永久困在地下室里
Dialogue: 1,3:26:28.75,3:26:30.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你玩过初代的TLOU
Dialogue: 1,3:26:30.37,3:26:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,你就知道感染者不是葡萄酒越陈越香
Dialogue: 1,3:26:34.66,3:26:39.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上在TLOU的世界里感染越久的感染者就越可怕
Dialogue: 1,3:26:39.49,3:26:44.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,也就是说你接下来即将在地下室看到的感染者
Dialogue: 1,3:26:44.31,3:26:47.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,很可能已经被关在那里25年了
Dialogue: 1,3:26:47.86,3:26:54.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,里面很可能隐藏着整个这座城市最最危险的感染者
Dialogue: 1,3:26:54.25,3:26:58.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,其他人我不清楚 但在我想通这一点的一瞬间
Dialogue: 1,3:26:58.09,3:27:00.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就知道我们可能即将面对全新的感染者 或者至少是新boss
Dialogue: 1,3:27:00.46,3:27:04.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就知道我们可能即将面对全新的感染者 或者至少是新boss
Dialogue: 1,3:27:04.21,3:27:06.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,我他妈可老期待了
Dialogue: 1,3:27:06.16,3:27:09.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,TLOU2里的感染者一般比较后知后觉
Dialogue: 1,3:27:09.64,3:27:14.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏对它们的关注不是很多 我也理解 游戏里要做的事情太多了
Dialogue: 1,3:27:14.11,3:27:19.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是有点怀念一代游戏里感染者的重要地位
Dialogue: 1,3:27:19.21,3:27:24.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以一想到自己马上要面对全新的感染者
Dialogue: 1,3:27:24.22,3:27:27.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就感觉非常有趣 摩拳擦掌
Dialogue: 1,3:27:27.13,3:27:29.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是诺拉带埃比来到了医院地下室
Dialogue: 1,3:27:29.28,3:27:32.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,让她自己去搜寻治疗雅拉胳膊的医疗用品
Dialogue: 1,3:27:32.18,3:27:34.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,就在这个时间点 前脚她送埃比去了地下室
Dialogue: 1,3:27:34.84,3:27:39.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家当然都清楚 后脚她就上楼遇到艾莉了
Dialogue: 1,3:27:39.49,3:27:45.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比此时进入的这个关卡区域 顽皮狗起名为“原爆点”
Dialogue: 1,3:27:45.28,3:27:47.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,事实上 她进入地下室后看到的一切东西
Dialogue: 1,3:27:47.71,3:27:50.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,都是从虫草菌疫情爆发后保留到现在的
Dialogue: 1,3:27:50.23,3:27:54.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至埃比也知道 这里可能会发生非常可怕的事情
Dialogue: 1,3:27:54.22,3:27:56.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这一点在她听到一些奇怪的声响后就立刻得到了验证
Dialogue: 1,3:27:56.72,3:28:00.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这一点在她听到一些奇怪的声响后就立刻得到了验证
Dialogue: 1,3:28:00.70,3:28:04.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比继续在整个区域里探索 寻找想要的物资
Dialogue: 1,3:28:04.81,3:28:09.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终她启动了发电机 打开了一些锁上的大门
Dialogue: 1,3:28:09.10,3:28:10.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果却发现……
Dialogue: 1,3:28:17.59,3:28:20.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 走廊的门都被撑开了
Dialogue: 1,3:28:20.26,3:28:22.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比心里明白这里有个超级巨大的东西
Dialogue: 1,3:28:22.87,3:28:24.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而她哪也去不了
Dialogue: 1,3:28:24.49,3:28:29.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比只能在地下室里到处找 最后在一辆救护车上找到了需要的物资
Dialogue: 1,3:28:29.68,3:28:34.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是当然了 恐惧来得也恰是时候
Dialogue: 1,3:28:34.51,3:28:35.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,这一坨感染者出现了
Dialogue: 1,3:28:57.28,3:29:03.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 这个超级吓人的感染者的出现带领玩家进入到了下一场Boss战
Dialogue: 1,3:29:03.22,3:29:07.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,它长得就跟一群感染者循声者紧急集合一样
Dialogue: 1,3:29:07.33,3:29:10.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,可老磕碜了
Dialogue: 1,3:29:10.57,3:29:15.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,怎么想都感觉这设计太让人印象深刻了
Dialogue: 1,3:29:15.04,3:29:17.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真没料到会是这样的怪物
Dialogue: 1,3:29:17.53,3:29:24.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而很遗憾的说 这只长相恶心的怪物并没有那么难
Dialogue: 1,3:29:24.07,3:29:29.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,它移动速度慢 如果不是绝地难度的话 对抗它的难度并不大
Dialogue: 1,3:29:29.89,3:29:33.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,它的速度慢到我甚至没把它当成一个威胁
Dialogue: 1,3:29:33.82,3:29:36.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 这玩意子弹打进去好像不痛不痒
Dialogue: 1,3:29:36.67,3:29:39.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果你弹药充足 就可以在建筑里和它绕
Dialogue: 1,3:29:39.79,3:29:41.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,伤害全都灌出去
Dialogue: 1,3:29:41.44,3:29:46.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其是这一层还散落很多动态生成的制造材料
Dialogue: 1,3:29:46.75,3:29:50.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你随时都可以捡东西 跑到角落 制造物品
Dialogue: 1,3:29:50.26,3:29:52.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,跑到另一个地方 装备好
Dialogue: 1,3:29:52.12,3:29:55.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后在需要的时候给它扔个爆破管或者燃烧瓶
Dialogue: 1,3:29:55.57,3:29:56.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我认为往大了说
Dialogue: 1,3:29:56.68,3:30:01.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个游戏的难度其实更偏向于敌人的数量
Dialogue: 1,3:30:01.30,3:30:04.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以……我操你……
Dialogue: 1,3:30:10.00,3:30:12.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,好吧 可太恶心了
Dialogue: 1,3:30:12.13,3:30:17.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以你把身上所有家伙事都喂给了这俩怪物 直到把它们都解决掉
Dialogue: 1,3:30:17.77,3:30:22.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,接着埃比带着所有要找的东西 从地下室回到了底面
Dialogue: 1,3:30:22.33,3:30:25.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,重新和勒弗汇合 一起回到了水族馆
Dialogue: 1,3:30:25.66,3:30:30.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,梅尔用这些新拿的医疗物资成功给雅拉的胳膊做了截肢手术
Dialogue: 1,3:30:30.73,3:30:32.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,而她也挺过来了
Dialogue: 1,3:30:32.29,3:30:35.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来埃比的新家庭要过上幸福美满的生活了
Dialogue: 1,3:30:35.77,3:30:39.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,可拉倒吧！ 这游戏里的故事可不是这么讲的
Dialogue: 1,3:30:39.13,3:30:40.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家心里应该早就清楚了
Dialogue: 1,3:30:40.48,3:30:45.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是在「西雅图 第2天」结束后 画面给到了埃比又一个梦境的闪回
Dialogue: 1,3:30:45.40,3:30:48.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比又一次来到她父亲遇害的医院
Dialogue: 1,3:30:48.33,3:30:52.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,进入发现她父亲尸体的那个房间
Dialogue: 1,3:30:52.15,3:30:57.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这次 她看到他还活着 满脸笑容
Dialogue: 1,3:30:57.13,3:31:01.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这里游戏在传达非常非常重要的一点
Dialogue: 1,3:31:01.18,3:31:03.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,一个大家都不能低估的点
Dialogue: 1,3:31:03.60,3:31:10.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 我认为这个很快的闪回片段 这片梦境的内容
Dialogue: 1,3:31:10.99,3:31:16.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,是整个埃比章节里最最重要的时刻
Dialogue: 1,3:31:16.72,3:31:21.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个埃比章节的核心 一言以蔽之 就是这个片段了 请听我细说
Dialogue: 1,3:31:21.65,3:31:24.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来 这一刻似乎代表了艾比
Dialogue: 1,3:31:24.49,3:31:28.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,终于为自己的罪孽和乔尔的死亡做了赎罪
Dialogue: 1,3:31:28.87,3:31:33.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时她也终于能平静地面对父亲的死了
Dialogue: 1,3:31:33.13,3:31:37.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,我的意思是说 至少她现在能睡个安稳觉了
Dialogue: 1,3:31:37.09,3:31:39.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为她不会再做噩梦了
Dialogue: 1,3:31:39.16,3:31:43.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,她梦见了她再一次和父亲产生了思想上的连接 这是一个好梦
Dialogue: 1,3:31:43.51,3:31:45.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果这都不算好梦 那天底下就全都是噩梦了
Dialogue: 1,3:31:45.49,3:31:50.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,此外 上次埃比的梦境中 她冲进房间 看到的是她父亲的死
Dialogue: 1,3:31:50.74,3:31:54.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,她还看到了雅拉和勒弗被吊起来开肠破肚
Dialogue: 1,3:31:54.78,3:31:57.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,正如我们在那场梦境中所说的那样
Dialogue: 1,3:31:57.58,3:31:59.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏在暗示我们
Dialogue: 1,3:31:59.43,3:32:03.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,雅拉和勒弗开始对埃比的心理产生了重大影响
Dialogue: 1,3:32:03.52,3:32:05.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,而当前就是弱化后的版本
Dialogue: 1,3:32:05.14,3:32:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想说的是 他们似乎开始在她的思想和生活中占据了以前她父亲的位置
Dialogue: 1,3:32:10.53,3:32:13.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想说的是 他们似乎开始在她的思想和生活中占据了以前她父亲的位置
Dialogue: 1,3:32:13.24,3:32:19.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一个家庭的位置 只保留给那些你真正关心的人
Dialogue: 1,3:32:19.00,3:32:22.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论这是否有意义 无论这是否合理
Dialogue: 1,3:32:22.56,3:32:27.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比的确是感受到了与雅拉和勒弗的强烈联系
Dialogue: 1,3:32:27.10,3:32:31.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能是因为他们在本不必要的时候救了埃比一命
Dialogue: 1,3:32:31.00,3:32:33.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许是因为还发生了别的事情 让彼此有了兴趣
Dialogue: 1,3:32:33.25,3:32:36.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许是因为还发生了别的事情 让彼此有了兴趣
Dialogue: 1,3:32:36.94,3:32:39.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之 他们走到这步了
Dialogue: 1,3:32:39.20,3:32:45.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比在这个场景中看到她父亲 满脸和蔼地看着她
Dialogue: 1,3:32:45.01,3:32:48.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,满脸写着一些都会好起来的
Dialogue: 1,3:32:48.52,3:32:51.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这里的意义太重大了
Dialogue: 1,3:32:51.79,3:32:53.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,她刚刚救了雅拉
Dialogue: 1,3:32:53.88,3:32:57.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时也间接地拯救了勒弗
Dialogue: 1,3:32:57.67,3:32:59.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,一切的心结都解开了
Dialogue: 1,3:32:59.53,3:33:03.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,据他们所知 明天他们要一起登上欧文的船
Dialogue: 1,3:33:03.97,3:33:06.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,前往圣塔芭芭拉
Dialogue: 1,3:33:06.10,3:33:09.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来真的要有一个美满的结局了
Dialogue: 1,3:33:09.04,3:33:12.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样 「西雅图 第2天」结束了
Dialogue: 1,3:33:12.25,3:33:16.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,「西雅图 第3天」 剧情从埃比睡觉醒来开始
Dialogue: 1,3:33:16.03,3:33:18.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,她睡得挺好 但梅尔生气了
Dialogue: 1,3:33:18.67,3:33:23.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,她基本上只是想让埃比离开她的欧文和那些新来的孩子
Dialogue: 1,3:33:23.29,3:33:27.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,梅尔还说如果埃比继续这样坚持下去 迟早会搞砸一切
Dialogue: 1,3:33:27.66,3:33:33.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比还不如让其他人去圣塔芭芭拉 自己继续留在WLF这里
Dialogue: 1,3:33:33.37,3:33:38.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为考虑到埃比刚刚和梅尔的孩子父亲搞过 这样的戏剧性变化还算合理
Dialogue: 1,3:33:38.52,3:33:42.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道梅尔是否知道这些 或者她是否知道并谈论过这些
Dialogue: 1,3:33:42.22,3:33:47.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,但无论如何 这让埃比非常伤心 她都哭了
Dialogue: 1,3:33:47.38,3:33:51.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是我们第一次看到这个外表如此坚强的人流泪
Dialogue: 1,3:33:51.49,3:33:52.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得埃比的确受到打击了
Dialogue: 1,3:33:52.93,3:33:56.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为她可能也感觉梅尔说的某种程度上是有道理的
Dialogue: 1,3:33:56.46,3:33:59.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,我跟你们说 埃比这人就有毒
Dialogue: 1,3:33:59.04,3:34:04.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,拽着一伙自己最好的朋友 横穿半个国家 只为杀一个人
Dialogue: 1,3:34:04.36,3:34:08.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时雅拉还在处理勒弗的事情 勒弗天真的以为
Dialogue: 1,3:34:08.40,3:34:12.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,自己能说服母亲放弃邪教加入他们
Dialogue: 1,3:34:12.45,3:34:18.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,雅拉显然知道这种对他们母亲的看法简直又天真又愚蠢
Dialogue: 1,3:34:18.70,3:34:22.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,但勒弗还是认为总有办法能做到
Dialogue: 1,3:34:22.12,3:34:27.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比和雅拉决定去找个小礼物安慰一下勒弗 让他心情好了以后能留下
Dialogue: 1,3:34:27.64,3:34:31.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 有一个不得不提的问题渐渐显现出来了
Dialogue: 1,3:34:31.69,3:34:34.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,我决定可能很多玩家都发现了这点
Dialogue: 1,3:34:34.12,3:34:38.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其如果你注意到了过去几小时游戏中的对话
Dialogue: 1,3:34:38.86,3:34:41.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,即勒弗是一位跨性别者
Dialogue: 1,3:34:41.16,3:34:44.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,在之前你和勒弗一同进行的一些战斗场景中
Dialogue: 1,3:34:44.38,3:34:48.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如之前在建筑工地大楼里对抗大量赛拉菲特帮那段
Dialogue: 1,3:34:48.10,3:34:53.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,赛拉菲特帮偶尔会管勒弗叫莉莉
Dialogue: 1,3:34:53.86,3:34:57.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 如果你在游戏的大部分时间都有注意过这些
Dialogue: 1,3:34:57.04,3:35:00.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你可能对此感觉或震惊或疑惑
Dialogue: 1,3:35:00.34,3:35:04.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,为什么他们会管这个角色叫莉莉而不是叫勒弗
Dialogue: 1,3:35:04.18,3:35:08.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,而也正是这个原因才导致雅拉和勒弗背离了他们的宗教组织
Dialogue: 1,3:35:08.74,3:35:11.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,勒弗本来会成为一位长老的妻子
Dialogue: 1,3:35:11.17,3:35:15.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,勒弗自然不喜欢这个决定、不同意
Dialogue: 1,3:35:15.16,3:35:18.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以最后他剃光了头发
Dialogue: 1,3:35:18.16,3:35:23.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,并希望别人以男性赛拉菲特教徒来看待他
Dialogue: 1,3:35:23.50,3:35:27.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,出去巡逻、接受训练、成为一名战士
Dialogue: 1,3:35:27.49,3:35:30.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,而相信大家都能预料到
Dialogue: 1,3:35:30.25,3:35:34.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,赛拉菲特帮肯定对这样的转变极其不满
Dialogue: 1,3:35:34.09,3:35:38.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他们决定要严厉惩罚勒弗
Dialogue: 1,3:35:38.32,3:35:43.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者至少他们不会允许这样另类的生活方式的存在
Dialogue: 1,3:35:43.93,3:35:50.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以雅拉这位坚定支持他的姐姐决定和勒弗一起出逃
Dialogue: 1,3:35:50.95,3:35:55.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 赛拉菲特人不停称这两个人是“叛徒”
Dialogue: 1,3:35:55.90,3:35:59.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时也解释了为什么在很多和赛拉菲特帮的战斗中
Dialogue: 1,3:35:59.11,3:36:03.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,对面会不停问雅拉和勒弗为什么要做这样的事
Dialogue: 1,3:36:03.37,3:36:07.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为不久前他们俩明明还“好好的”
Dialogue: 1,3:36:07.51,3:36:10.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在关于这个情节上出现了很多争论
Dialogue: 1,3:36:10.36,3:36:15.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,四面八方的玩家对这个话题是否处理得当都有很激烈的讨论
Dialogue: 1,3:36:15.64,3:36:16.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,而说实话
Dialogue: 1,3:36:16.90,3:36:20.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得自己并没有资格在这一点上做出判断
Dialogue: 1,3:36:20.47,3:36:23.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对我来说 似乎处理得相对不错
Dialogue: 1,3:36:23.65,3:36:26.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,尽管在水族馆的这个特定场景中
Dialogue: 1,3:36:26.20,3:36:29.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,雅拉和埃比谈论到这件事时
Dialogue: 1,3:36:29.17,3:36:30.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,气氛看起来有点沉重
Dialogue: 1,3:36:30.98,3:36:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,我第一次明白这件事是在几小时之前
Dialogue: 1,3:36:34.66,3:36:40.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人在电梯井里的时候 勒弗亲自问过埃比
Dialogue: 1,3:36:40.27,3:36:43.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,是否听到过其他赛拉菲特人怎么称呼他
Dialogue: 1,3:36:43.63,3:36:50.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,这显然就是在指赛拉菲特帮管他叫“莉莉”“叛徒”这个事情
Dialogue: 1,3:36:50.50,3:36:54.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比说自己好像听说过 但她觉得这个话题不需要讨论
Dialogue: 1,3:36:54.22,3:36:57.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这是一种相当谨慎的处理方式
Dialogue: 1,3:36:57.22,3:37:00.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,勒弗可能并不太愿意谈论这个问题
Dialogue: 1,3:37:00.22,3:37:04.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且坦率地讲 这对他们的最终目标并不那么重要
Dialogue: 1,3:37:04.66,3:37:07.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是为什么我一直很喜欢顽皮狗之前的作品
Dialogue: 1,3:37:07.95,3:37:12.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们的故事中会有很多各种各样的角色
Dialogue: 1,3:37:12.91,3:37:16.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这方面的内容通常并不是评判这个角色的点
Dialogue: 1,3:37:16.30,3:37:19.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果一代TLOU里有一个同性恋角色
Dialogue: 1,3:37:19.03,3:37:24.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么这个角色就在那里 你要是注意到了就注意到了
Dialogue: 1,3:37:24.01,3:37:27.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这并不会成为那个角色决定性的标签
Dialogue: 1,3:37:27.82,3:37:31.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,当一个人完全被自己的一些特征所评判的时候
Dialogue: 1,3:37:31.90,3:37:36.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论是性认同、信仰或是外表
Dialogue: 1,3:37:36.82,3:37:41.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,都是不好的 因为人远比这些表面的东西复杂
Dialogue: 1,3:37:41.77,3:37:45.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,你也不应该把你自己单纯归结为某一个特征
Dialogue: 1,3:37:45.16,3:37:47.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为你远比这一点有内涵得多
Dialogue: 1,3:37:47.29,3:37:51.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么一般来说 我觉得顽皮狗处理这类事情的方法是不错的
Dialogue: 1,3:37:51.49,3:37:54.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们没有以此来评判某个角色
Dialogue: 1,3:37:54.40,3:38:01.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而在TLOU2和他们之前的作品《神秘海域：失落的遗产》中
Dialogue: 1,3:38:01.72,3:38:05.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗开始陷入角色特征的怪圈里了
Dialogue: 1,3:38:05.17,3:38:10.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们开始让一个角色纯粹以外部特征来定义自己
Dialogue: 1,3:38:10.63,3:38:15.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然我对这个特点本身没有意见
Dialogue: 1,3:38:15.70,3:38:18.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为仅仅通过一个特征来定义你正在制作的角色并将其放入故事中
Dialogue: 1,3:38:18.75,3:38:21.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为仅仅通过一个特征来定义你正在制作的角色并将其放入故事中
Dialogue: 1,3:38:21.40,3:38:23.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,是在创作上偷懒
Dialogue: 1,3:38:23.04,3:38:27.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,并且我认为这对那些在现实中有相同特征的人来说是一种不尊重
Dialogue: 1,3:38:27.91,3:38:32.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,尽管如此 我仍认为这个问题处理得相对不错 如果不是写得太沉重就更好了
Dialogue: 1,3:38:32.29,3:38:35.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也不是在爆料什么关键性的秘密
Dialogue: 1,3:38:35.95,3:38:39.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且据我所知 多数人根本不在乎这件事
Dialogue: 1,3:38:39.70,3:38:41.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也难免会认为
Dialogue: 1,3:38:41.48,3:38:46.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗把这样的“爆料”放在游戏的后期进行
Dialogue: 1,3:38:46.00,3:38:49.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,很可能是考虑到如果玩家已经玩到这里 那很可能会更加理解这个事情
Dialogue: 1,3:38:49.81,3:38:52.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,相反如果过早地就敞开了说这个话题
Dialogue: 1,3:38:52.87,3:38:55.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,那它很容易会变成舆论的焦点了
Dialogue: 1,3:38:55.68,3:38:57.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能是明智的考虑 也可能单纯是怂
Dialogue: 1,3:38:57.67,3:39:00.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能在游戏后期说这个只是因为巧合
Dialogue: 1,3:39:00.79,3:39:04.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也不清楚 我也不在乎
Dialogue: 1,3:39:04.45,3:39:05.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这也不重要
Dialogue: 1,3:39:05.80,3:39:08.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,在他们给勒弗选好礼物后
Dialogue: 1,3:39:08.83,3:39:14.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们来到水族馆外面 结果却看到勒弗自己开船跑了
Dialogue: 1,3:39:14.48,3:39:18.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,他直奔赛拉菲特的大本营所在的小岛
Dialogue: 1,3:39:18.00,3:39:20.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,勒弗想去救他的妈妈
Dialogue: 1,3:39:20.02,3:39:23.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这真是……真的蠢死了
Dialogue: 1,3:39:23.77,3:39:26.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,这一刻我真的感觉有点迷惑
Dialogue: 1,3:39:26.26,3:39:29.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为勒弗看着也挺成熟的 也不傻啊
Dialogue: 1,3:39:29.89,3:39:34.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,是 他是年轻 但这跟年纪没啥直接关系
Dialogue: 1,3:39:34.44,3:39:37.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,你完全可以有与你年纪不相仿的智慧
Dialogue: 1,3:39:37.30,3:39:40.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如一代里的艾莉 一样很年轻
Dialogue: 1,3:39:40.60,3:39:42.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,但从来不会干这么幼稚的事情
Dialogue: 1,3:39:42.70,3:39:46.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得换作是艾莉 她就不会这么冲动
Dialogue: 1,3:39:46.60,3:39:49.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少会花一点时间好好想想解决办法
Dialogue: 1,3:39:49.92,3:39:55.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,来处理这个可能永远离开她母亲的潜在问题
Dialogue: 1,3:39:55.84,3:40:00.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而因为顽皮狗需要一个理由来向玩家展示赛拉菲特岛
Dialogue: 1,3:40:00.96,3:40:05.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,和WLF对这座岛即将发动的突袭
Dialogue: 1,3:40:05.05,3:40:09.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们只好把这些事件草草拼凑起来说“你看 勒弗奔那个岛去了”
Dialogue: 1,3:40:09.55,3:40:13.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后玩家就会跟着勒弗 到那里看到所有疯狂的东西
Dialogue: 1,3:40:13.45,3:40:17.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这又有点强凑巧合
Dialogue: 1,3:40:17.68,3:40:28.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,似乎编剧有点想把人物强行塞进一个没有预先设定好上下文的环境中去
Dialogue: 1,3:40:28.06,3:40:30.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么这里的时机是如此重要
Dialogue: 1,3:40:30.46,3:40:34.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为埃比的团队要尽量在风暴来临之前离开西雅图
Dialogue: 1,3:40:34.81,3:40:41.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,而那场风暴将用来掩护伊萨克向塞拉特特岛的最后突袭
Dialogue: 1,3:40:41.02,3:40:45.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,而伊萨克无论如何都不会放弃这次突袭的机会
Dialogue: 1,3:40:45.46,3:40:48.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像在游戏早期说的 他已经受够了打打杀杀
Dialogue: 1,3:40:48.97,3:40:52.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是为什么他把所有装备都投入了前线
Dialogue: 1,3:40:52.09,3:40:55.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们要破釜沉舟 和疤脸帮决一死战
Dialogue: 1,3:40:55.09,3:40:58.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们要破釜沉舟 和疤脸帮决一死战
Dialogue: 1,3:40:58.18,3:41:03.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,而与此同时 埃比可以利用这场风暴作为掩护 逃到圣塔芭芭拉
Dialogue: 1,3:41:03.97,3:41:06.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而这个问题好像没那么重要
Dialogue: 1,3:41:06.00,3:41:10.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为实际上 埃比、欧文、梅尔、雅拉和勒弗
Dialogue: 1,3:41:10.53,3:41:13.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,并不需要那么多的掩护就能逃走
Dialogue: 1,3:41:13.21,3:41:15.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,船在他们手里 开走就完事了
Dialogue: 1,3:41:15.67,3:41:21.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,就我对游戏中WLF的了解 他们并不会主动在水面上巡逻
Dialogue: 1,3:41:21.04,3:41:22.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们的确有船
Dialogue: 1,3:41:22.57,3:41:27.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,几分钟后就能看到埃比和雅拉去码头弄船
Dialogue: 1,3:41:27.85,3:41:30.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,但WLF并不会主动去海上巡逻
Dialogue: 1,3:41:30.31,3:41:32.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也不清楚 如果他们真的会在水域上巡逻
Dialogue: 1,3:41:32.29,3:41:36.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,那这些人可能的确需要风暴的掩护才能出逃
Dialogue: 1,3:41:36.46,3:41:41.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,那就有意思了 但我并没有看到游戏在哪里明显提到过这一点
Dialogue: 1,3:41:41.44,3:41:43.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果大家有看到 欢迎在评论区指出
Dialogue: 1,3:41:43.84,3:41:48.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比和雅拉自然就决定要去把勒弗追回来
Dialogue: 1,3:41:48.07,3:41:50.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为勒弗上岛以后
Dialogue: 1,3:41:50.53,3:41:54.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,一旦被其他赛拉菲特帮的人看到 就很可能会被立刻杀掉
Dialogue: 1,3:41:54.64,3:41:57.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,一旦被其他赛拉菲特帮的人看到 就很可能会被立刻杀掉
Dialogue: 1,3:41:57.40,3:42:00.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比和雅拉两人一起前往船坞
Dialogue: 1,3:42:00.34,3:42:06.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们最后听到了狙击枪响 埃比让雅拉留在下面
Dialogue: 1,3:42:06.10,3:42:08.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟她这时候只剩一条胳膊了
Dialogue: 1,3:42:08.53,3:42:12.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以让她在船坞里到处乱跑实在是有点为难人
Dialogue: 1,3:42:12.80,3:42:16.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以让她在船坞里到处乱跑实在是有点为难人
Dialogue: 1,3:42:16.03,3:42:19.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家最后来到一处开阔地带
Dialogue: 1,3:42:19.37,3:42:24.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后突然有个人冲出来把你扑倒……竟然是曼尼
Dialogue: 1,3:42:24.76,3:42:26.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,狙击手就在对面
Dialogue: 1,3:42:26.26,3:42:30.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,他一直瞄着你 而且已经解决掉好多曼尼的手下
Dialogue: 1,3:42:30.19,3:42:34.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比和曼尼一起向前推进 想要干掉这个狙击手
Dialogue: 1,3:42:34.39,3:42:37.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段游戏内容其实很爽 细节拉满
Dialogue: 1,3:42:37.45,3:42:42.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,大家可以看看埃比在这块掩体后匍匐前行时狙击手射击的细节
Dialogue: 1,3:42:42.10,3:42:46.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,打到上面尸体的脑袋甚至还会崩出脑浆
Dialogue: 1,3:42:46.81,3:42:49.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,让这段内容非常扣人心弦
Dialogue: 1,3:42:49.72,3:42:52.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道这个画面是每次都会发生
Dialogue: 1,3:42:52.39,3:42:56.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是我视频中这段是巧合打到那个尸体的脑袋了
Dialogue: 1,3:42:56.32,3:42:57.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,但无论如何
Dialogue: 1,3:42:57.28,3:43:01.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个画面让我很震撼 临场感非常强
Dialogue: 1,3:43:01.80,3:43:06.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在快速回顾一下 大家还记得几小时前杰西和艾莉分开
Dialogue: 1,3:43:06.76,3:43:09.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们听说码头那边有狙击手
Dialogue: 1,3:43:09.37,3:43:11.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后他们认为那个人一定是汤米吗？
Dialogue: 1,3:43:11.65,3:43:14.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以杰西和艾莉分开了
Dialogue: 1,3:43:14.23,3:43:18.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以杰西可以去找汤米 艾莉可以去水族馆
Dialogue: 1,3:43:18.79,3:43:24.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外 大家还记得之前艾莉闪回中的狙击课程吗？
Dialogue: 1,3:43:24.07,3:43:27.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,我当时说这并不是单纯的狙击课程
Dialogue: 1,3:43:27.49,3:43:31.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使狙击枪在游戏其他部分再也不会用到
Dialogue: 1,3:43:31.03,3:43:33.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,你看 就是为了这里而铺垫的
Dialogue: 1,3:43:33.20,3:43:37.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏要给玩家建立一种 汤米是个神枪手的概念
Dialogue: 1,3:43:37.72,3:43:40.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,不然你以为这个神枪手能是谁？
Dialogue: 1,3:43:40.48,3:43:43.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论玩家在这个特定的时刻是否意识到这一点
Dialogue: 1,3:43:43.87,3:43:47.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为并不太重要 因为无论如何你都要继续向前推进
Dialogue: 1,3:43:47.05,3:43:49.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得如果你没意识到这个人是汤米的话剧情反而可能会更酷
Dialogue: 1,3:43:49.33,3:43:52.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得如果你没意识到这个人是汤米的话剧情反而可能会更酷
Dialogue: 1,3:43:52.93,3:43:56.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,当你以为这个狙击手只是一个普通NPC的时候
Dialogue: 1,3:43:56.11,3:44:01.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,你去追击、朝他射击、尝试解决他的时候可能内心感受会更轻松一点
Dialogue: 1,3:44:01.18,3:44:05.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,而当你意识到这个人可能是你有点喜欢的角色
Dialogue: 1,3:44:05.08,3:44:10.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他却在主动威胁另一个你开始喜欢、关心的角色的生命的时候
Dialogue: 1,3:44:10.72,3:44:17.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,才造就了这样有趣的戏剧冲突 造就了TLOU2这样奇怪诡异的故事
Dialogue: 1,3:44:17.29,3:44:20.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和曼尼把狙击手逼到了角落
Dialogue: 1,3:44:20.53,3:44:22.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而当他们以为自己马上就要解决掉他的时候……
Dialogue: 1,3:44:22.09,3:44:25.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而当他们以为自己马上就要解决掉他的时候……
Dialogue: 1,3:44:55.96,3:44:58.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,就这样 曼尼死了
Dialogue: 1,3:44:58.36,3:45:00.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比吓疯了
Dialogue: 1,3:45:00.85,3:45:04.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里给我的感觉就像杰西突然领盒饭一样
Dialogue: 1,3:45:04.12,3:45:06.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,一切是如此突然 毫无预兆
Dialogue: 1,3:45:06.99,3:45:09.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样的类比再一次出现了
Dialogue: 1,3:45:09.46,3:45:13.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉毫无预兆地突然就失去了一位亲密的朋友
Dialogue: 1,3:45:13.78,3:45:17.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家也要应付这样突如其来的打击
Dialogue: 1,3:45:17.98,3:45:23.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在埃比也失去了她的好朋友 也要面对完全相同的境地
Dialogue: 1,3:45:23.68,3:45:25.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是你稍微绕了一下
Dialogue: 1,3:45:25.27,3:45:26.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后埃比穿过了这扇门……
Dialogue: 1,3:46:14.23,3:46:20.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你注意到她的就表情就能明白 埃比知道那个人是谁
Dialogue: 1,3:46:20.20,3:46:25.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,她知道汤米来了 而这非常非常糟糕
Dialogue: 1,3:46:25.93,3:46:32.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,有多糟糕？刚刚你和曼尼在上面公路上的时候他说过
Dialogue: 1,3:46:32.68,3:46:38.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,有不止一个闯入者在乱杀WLF的成员
Dialogue: 1,3:46:47.41,3:46:52.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,这意味这就算她能秒了汤米 当然这显然不可能
Dialogue: 1,3:46:52.96,3:46:58.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,外面还有很多人在屠杀WLF的成员
Dialogue: 1,3:46:58.03,3:47:02.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,而汤米在这 很可能说明杰克逊小镇的一帮人
Dialogue: 1,3:47:02.64,3:47:06.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,来找她为乔尔复仇了
Dialogue: 1,3:47:06.27,3:47:09.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,但埃比现在没那么多功夫为这件事感到害怕了
Dialogue: 1,3:47:09.58,3:47:14.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,她把这个问题放在一边 坐上她们从码头弄来的船前往岛上
Dialogue: 1,3:47:14.08,3:47:19.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然 WLF成员偶尔也会使用这些船
Dialogue: 1,3:47:19.18,3:47:23.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,她的目标很简单 需要找到勒弗然后离开
Dialogue: 1,3:47:23.40,3:47:29.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果能速战速决 应该可以避开艾莉和她的整个复仇团队
Dialogue: 1,3:47:29.26,3:47:32.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和雅拉来到了疤脸帮的岛屿
Dialogue: 1,3:47:32.20,3:47:36.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,雅拉带路 把埃比领进了她的营地的核心区域
Dialogue: 1,3:47:36.76,3:47:41.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里一个有趣的事情是 雅拉和勒弗仍然保有对邪教的信仰
Dialogue: 1,3:47:41.80,3:47:43.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使他们已和组织里的领导者站在对立面
Dialogue: 1,3:47:58.84,3:48:00.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,说实话我真不太理解这个地方
Dialogue: 1,3:48:00.97,3:48:06.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,我听过这类故事 邪教的人出来后仍然对其半信半疑
Dialogue: 1,3:48:06.07,3:48:09.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,尽管他们认为宗教内部已经有些腐败
Dialogue: 1,3:48:09.07,3:48:11.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们好像还是会相信这些
Dialogue: 1,3:48:11.77,3:48:14.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不太确定 但我觉得还是挺有意思的
Dialogue: 1,3:48:14.16,3:48:18.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为毕竟这些孩子们出生就在这样的邪教团体里
Dialogue: 1,3:48:18.85,3:48:24.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他们因为死亡的威胁而离开这里
Dialogue: 1,3:48:24.22,3:48:30.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,但仍然对邪教的精神偶像有所崇拜 或至少是尊重 还是说得通的
Dialogue: 1,3:48:30.31,3:48:32.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 她们一进入岛屿腹地
Dialogue: 1,3:48:32.60,3:48:36.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和雅拉就看到了赛拉菲特人涌入军械库
Dialogue: 1,3:48:36.04,3:48:39.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,准备应对WLF开始对他们进行的突袭
Dialogue: 1,3:48:39.34,3:48:45.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们看到WLF的成员正在登陆岛屿 打了一个措手不及
Dialogue: 1,3:48:45.00,3:48:50.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,说实话 我对赛拉菲特帮没有预料到此事感觉有一点惊讶
Dialogue: 1,3:48:50.26,3:48:52.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们在城里有如此宏伟的基建
Dialogue: 1,3:48:52.81,3:48:57.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像之前看到的 几座大楼屋顶之间有通行的“桥梁” 他们自己也都很机敏
Dialogue: 1,3:48:57.55,3:48:59.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以似乎应该能够意识到
Dialogue: 1,3:48:59.99,3:49:03.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,WLF正在动员某种突袭行动
Dialogue: 1,3:49:03.55,3:49:09.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟他们刚把全部物资全部兵力都集中到了中心区域
Dialogue: 1,3:49:09.76,3:49:14.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果这都没让赛拉菲特的首领警觉的话 那他是干什么吃的
Dialogue: 1,3:49:14.13,3:49:16.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总之 他们现在开始准备防守了
Dialogue: 1,3:49:16.48,3:49:22.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这为你在这座岛屿上探索留出了空间 也让你能推进到勒弗和雅拉的房子
Dialogue: 1,3:49:22.18,3:49:27.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,在这个过程中你会发现很多有赛拉菲特帮的区域 以潜行通过为主
Dialogue: 1,3:49:27.58,3:49:29.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,算是让你在去他们家的路上不那么无聊 不用单纯坐着看播片了
Dialogue: 1,3:49:29.86,3:49:34.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,算是让你在去他们家的路上不那么无聊 不用单纯坐着看播片了
Dialogue: 1,3:49:34.15,3:49:37.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,终于你们来到了房子前 开门进去后 看到了这样的场景
Dialogue: 1,3:51:01.03,3:51:05.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段真没什么好震惊的 他妈肯定永远不会理解的
Dialogue: 1,3:51:05.47,3:51:09.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,但同样重要的是 勒弗现在已经无所挂念了
Dialogue: 1,3:51:09.94,3:51:13.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点提醒了我 即游戏希望他们离开西雅图的时候能完全不带任何包袱
Dialogue: 1,3:51:13.68,3:51:15.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点提醒了我 即游戏希望他们离开西雅图的时候能完全不带任何包袱
Dialogue: 1,3:51:15.93,3:51:22.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,每当一个游戏或故事开始切断一个角色的家庭和友好关系时
Dialogue: 1,3:51:22.76,3:51:26.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,通常意味着他们正准备进行某种大的过渡
Dialogue: 1,3:51:26.39,3:51:30.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样他们就不会留下包袱 也不用费劲去解释这个包袱了
Dialogue: 1,3:51:30.10,3:51:33.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而我个人认为这样有点多此一举
Dialogue: 1,3:51:33.40,3:51:37.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为把勒弗和雅拉的母亲留在这里没什么问题
Dialogue: 1,3:51:37.93,3:51:41.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟她已经深陷一个想要杀死他们两人的邪教组织
Dialogue: 1,3:51:41.88,3:51:44.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 埃比、雅拉和勒弗一起向码头推进
Dialogue: 1,3:51:44.86,3:51:48.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们要在码头找船 再开回水族馆
Dialogue: 1,3:51:48.28,3:51:54.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,我到现在都没整明白为什么他们不去找来岛时的那条船
Dialogue: 1,3:51:54.55,3:51:57.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论如何他们都要去码头再另找一条船逃回去
Dialogue: 1,3:51:57.31,3:52:01.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论如何他们都要去码头再另找一条船逃回去
Dialogue: 1,3:52:01.03,3:52:04.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道是来岛的时候船坏了
Dialogue: 1,3:52:04.18,3:52:08.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是什么原因导致他们不能用从WLF那弄来的船
Dialogue: 1,3:52:08.47,3:52:12.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之就是不能用
Dialogue: 1,3:52:12.01,3:52:13.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这单纯就是想让角色去看看岛上镇子的核心区域
Dialogue: 1,3:52:13.61,3:52:17.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这单纯就是想让角色去看看岛上镇子的核心区域
Dialogue: 1,3:52:17.28,3:52:22.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,从而看看WLF和赛拉菲特帮大战时一片混乱的场景
Dialogue: 1,3:52:22.42,3:52:27.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,用意我能理解 但这前后逻辑还是没接上
Dialogue: 1,3:52:27.10,3:52:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为俩人刚把一条船开上岛
Dialogue: 1,3:52:29.80,3:52:32.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,比他们之后要去拿的船近多了
Dialogue: 1,3:52:32.56,3:52:33.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不明白
Dialogue: 1,3:52:33.05,3:52:36.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果他们有什么更好的理由不去取来时的那条船
Dialogue: 1,3:52:36.79,3:52:37.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,请告诉我 谢谢
Dialogue: 1,3:52:37.50,3:52:41.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是三人穿过一个完全被遗弃的镇子
Dialogue: 1,3:52:41.74,3:52:44.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来赛拉菲特帮完全没有在这里巡逻的意思
Dialogue: 1,3:52:44.92,3:52:47.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这些都是旧世界的糟粕
Dialogue: 1,3:52:47.08,3:52:49.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,一切都是那么安静 直到……
Dialogue: 1,3:55:04.09,3:55:09.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是现在开始我们和勒弗搭档对抗我们曾经的队友——WLF成员
Dialogue: 1,3:55:09.24,3:55:12.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,但说实话 这段实在是游戏中情感上的一大困惑点
Dialogue: 1,3:55:12.37,3:55:17.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为相当多的人都在争论埃比为什么要这样做
Dialogue: 1,3:55:17.96,3:55:22.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们可能不认识WLF的这些人 但埃比认识啊
Dialogue: 1,3:55:22.09,3:55:25.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,她在戕害曾经和她一起工作过的 她所了解的
Dialogue: 1,3:55:25.67,3:55:29.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,并没有做错任何事情的人啊
Dialogue: 1,3:55:29.47,3:55:33.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这一切只是为了勒弗 一个跟她没有任何关系的人
Dialogue: 1,3:55:33.96,3:55:37.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,她根本没有任何理由要去关心他
Dialogue: 1,3:55:37.63,3:55:41.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,这太离谱了 兄弟们 这是人干的事吗？
Dialogue: 1,3:55:41.65,3:55:44.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,谁会为了某个不相干的人而杀死自己以前曾一起共事的人
Dialogue: 1,3:55:44.24,3:55:45.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,谁会为了某个不相干的人而杀死自己以前曾一起共事的人
Dialogue: 1,3:55:45.92,3:55:49.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是因为你俩建立了某种羁绊所以你关心他？
Dialogue: 1,3:55:49.06,3:55:49.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,哦对
Dialogue: 1,3:55:57.07,3:56:00.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是埃比和勒弗看到了伊萨克他们干的好事
Dialogue: 1,3:56:00.28,3:56:04.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,WLF在对岛屿施行焦土政策
Dialogue: 1,3:56:04.24,3:56:08.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们一边前往码头获取离岛的船
Dialogue: 1,3:56:08.17,3:56:13.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,一边同时和几波疤脸帮与WLF士兵作战
Dialogue: 1,3:56:13.69,3:56:18.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,有时是是遇到两伙人正在掐架 我们只是想路过 结果也被卷进去了
Dialogue: 1,3:56:18.64,3:56:20.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 感觉挺帅的
Dialogue: 1,3:56:20.42,3:56:25.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,看这些敌人互相打架互相杀 自己在旁边看戏
Dialogue: 1,3:56:25.54,3:56:27.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,太爽了
Dialogue: 1,3:56:27.13,3:56:31.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这些场景里比较糟糕的一点是这里一只感染者都没有
Dialogue: 1,3:56:31.06,3:56:35.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然作为评测这样的话没什么意义
Dialogue: 1,3:56:35.77,3:56:41.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这是一座赛拉菲特帮生活了很久的岛
Dialogue: 1,3:56:41.29,3:56:47.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们很可能早就清空了岛上的感染者 保持疫情常态化防控
Dialogue: 1,3:56:47.15,3:56:51.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然了 很多人认为这一个打僵尸的游戏
Dialogue: 1,3:56:51.48,3:56:55.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩了几小时一个感染者都没看到感觉有点怪
Dialogue: 1,3:56:55.12,3:56:58.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得还是合理的 至少在他们构建的这样一个世界里
Dialogue: 1,3:56:58.63,3:57:03.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,TLOU比以往普通打僵尸游戏的世界观要复杂得多
Dialogue: 1,3:57:03.04,3:57:08.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,把TLOU和那些普通的打僵尸游戏去对比实在有点让人不爽
Dialogue: 1,3:57:08.92,3:57:11.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,最后 埃比和勒弗找到了一匹马
Dialogue: 1,3:57:11.71,3:57:15.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,骑上它 直扎赛拉菲特帮的都城部分
Dialogue: 1,3:57:15.82,3:57:20.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里的视觉效果真的非常震撼 我真的要好好表扬一下
Dialogue: 1,3:57:20.59,3:57:23.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,光影是如此酷炫
Dialogue: 1,3:57:23.08,3:57:29.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段场景可能是整个游戏里在视觉效果上给我留下印象最深的部分了
Dialogue: 1,3:57:29.29,3:57:32.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比骑马沿着码头边缘前行
Dialogue: 1,3:57:32.95,3:57:36.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,杀了越来越多的WLF士兵和赛拉菲特帮
Dialogue: 1,3:57:36.43,3:57:37.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,爬上一座着火的房子
Dialogue: 1,3:57:37.66,3:57:42.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,你终于来到了这章最后一个boss面前
Dialogue: 1,3:57:42.04,3:57:44.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,这次还是和海尔格那样的野蛮人
Dialogue: 1,3:57:44.35,3:57:48.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上游戏这里的模型网格变形系统非常厉害
Dialogue: 1,3:57:48.49,3:57:52.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,随着他身体出现割伤 他的人物模型的确会跟着有损伤变化
Dialogue: 1,3:57:52.21,3:57:53.71,辉中,,0,0,0,,皮肤会外翻
Dialogue: 1,3:57:53.71,3:57:55.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,效果真的很震撼
Dialogue: 1,3:57:55.15,3:58:03.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,遗憾的是这种特性不能以这样的真实度应用到整个游戏里的全部角色上
Dialogue: 1,3:58:03.19,3:58:08.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得TLOU2里的模型网格变形系统和断肢系统本来就够牛逼了
Dialogue: 1,3:58:08.65,3:58:12.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,但如果人人都能到这个角色的程度 那就逆天了
Dialogue: 1,3:58:12.28,3:58:16.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,希望能在下一代主机上能看到这样程度的模型质量
Dialogue: 1,3:58:16.78,3:58:20.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,我总感觉如果真能做到的话 那这游戏可老爽了
Dialogue: 1,3:58:20.59,3:58:26.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能这个特性最好的应用就是你用镰刀把他的脸割开的时候
Dialogue: 1,3:58:26.64,3:58:31.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,在我看来划出的伤口刚好在那个地方不可能只是巧合
Dialogue: 1,3:58:31.69,3:58:35.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟“疤脸帮”的名字摆在那
Dialogue: 1,3:58:35.30,3:58:41.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他们会刻意、心甘情愿地在脸上划出这样的疤痕
Dialogue: 1,3:58:41.08,3:58:45.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,我现在把这当成了埃比和勒弗对赛拉菲特帮
Dialogue: 1,3:58:45.56,3:58:49.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,给勒弗和雅拉造成肉体和心灵上伤害的一种反击
Dialogue: 1,3:58:49.66,3:58:53.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说 用疤脸帮眼中神圣的行为
Dialogue: 1,3:58:53.65,3:58:56.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,去以牙还牙 血债血偿
Dialogue: 1,3:58:56.14,3:58:59.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然也可能是我自己过度解读了
Dialogue: 1,3:58:59.44,3:59:02.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 在打败这个野蛮人后 埃比和勒弗上了一条划艇
Dialogue: 1,3:59:02.92,3:59:06.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人从燃着熊熊烈火的岛屿返回了水族馆
Dialogue: 1,3:59:06.52,3:59:11.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们不清楚这之后发生了什么 这场战斗结果如何
Dialogue: 1,3:59:11.44,3:59:14.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得这不重要
Dialogue: 1,3:59:14.23,3:59:16.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们知道的是 伊萨克死了
Dialogue: 1,3:59:16.30,3:59:20.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,WLF群龙无首 溃不成军
Dialogue: 1,3:59:20.98,3:59:25.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我觉得他们的突袭失败了 赛拉菲特守住了自己的领地
Dialogue: 1,3:59:25.00,3:59:26.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,但管他呢 不重要
Dialogue: 1,3:59:26.95,3:59:32.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,回到水族馆 埃比看到了欧文、梅尔，和那条叫爱丽丝的狗的尸体
Dialogue: 1,3:59:32.98,3:59:39.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,她精神完全崩溃了 看起来编剧的任务也完成了
Dialogue: 1,3:59:39.03,3:59:43.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,几小时的游戏之前 我们根本毫不关心的游戏角色
Dialogue: 1,3:59:43.72,3:59:46.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,被艾莉残忍杀害后
Dialogue: 1,3:59:46.12,3:59:49.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在在我们心中有了一席之地
Dialogue: 1,3:59:49.63,3:59:51.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们认识这些角色
Dialogue: 1,3:59:51.28,3:59:55.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可能不那么关心梅尔 不那么在意欧文
Dialogue: 1,3:59:55.45,3:59:59.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,但你真的开始在乎埃比和勒弗
Dialogue: 1,3:59:59.50,4:00:04.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,看着她悲痛欲绝的样子 我也难免感觉很伤心
Dialogue: 1,4:00:04.12,4:00:06.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,而更惨的是在此时
Dialogue: 1,4:00:06.16,4:00:11.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比甚至不知道她的很多其他成员也都已经死了
Dialogue: 1,4:00:11.56,4:00:17.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,据我所知 她应该还不知道诺拉已经被艾莉残忍杀害
Dialogue: 1,4:00:17.20,4:00:22.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,她不知道艾莉为了追杀埃比一路过来杀死的其他人
Dialogue: 1,4:00:22.72,4:00:23.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且说实话
Dialogue: 1,4:00:23.44,4:00:27.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,我甚至觉得埃比可能到最后都不知道其他人的死
Dialogue: 1,4:00:27.81,4:00:31.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为据我所知 在之后的剧情结束后 她直接离开了
Dialogue: 1,4:00:31.90,4:00:35.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们前往圣塔芭芭拉开始了新的生活
Dialogue: 1,4:00:35.44,4:00:40.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,重点是 埃比此时悲愤至极 她开启了狂怒模式
Dialogue: 1,4:00:40.87,4:00:43.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,还记得杰西和汤米把艾莉带走时她落在这里的地图吗
Dialogue: 1,4:00:43.72,4:00:46.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,还记得杰西和汤米把艾莉带走时她落在这里的地图吗
Dialogue: 1,4:00:46.51,4:00:48.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,被埃比找到了
Dialogue: 1,4:00:48.28,4:00:54.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,她捡起地图 发现艾莉很贴心的在他们的所在地画了个大圆圈
Dialogue: 1,4:00:54.94,4:01:00.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是 埃比和勒弗前往了杰克逊四人帮的藏身处 想要把汤米揪出来
Dialogue: 1,4:01:00.44,4:01:05.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,别忘了 据埃比这边所了解 那边只有汤米和他的几个帮手
Dialogue: 1,4:01:05.53,4:01:08.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们唯一了解的事实是汤米在那里
Dialogue: 1,4:01:08.05,4:01:12.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我估计埃比可能真的认为自己只会找到汤米
Dialogue: 1,4:01:12.35,4:01:14.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果他们进入剧院后 找到了所有人
Dialogue: 1,4:01:14.76,4:01:20.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,先是在剧院前台的汤米 然后是杰西 然后艾莉也破门而出
Dialogue: 1,4:03:12.01,4:03:14.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,此时游戏来到了高潮
Dialogue: 1,4:03:14.17,4:03:20.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,你操控埃比追杀艾莉 一路来到了剧院里面、后台和道具间
Dialogue: 1,4:03:20.14,4:03:26.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,到这里 我们开始操控我们游戏开始时憎恨的、想要杀死的角色
Dialogue: 1,4:03:26.56,4:03:28.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,把双方位置互换
Dialogue: 1,4:03:28.84,4:03:35.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,开始追杀我们喜欢了近十年的一位角色——艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:03:35.02,4:03:37.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,开始追杀我们喜欢了近十年的一位角色——艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:03:37.18,4:03:42.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,根据大家在那份调查里给出的回复
Dialogue: 1,4:03:42.04,4:03:47.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上有相当多的人在游戏玩到这里时放弃了
Dialogue: 1,4:03:47.59,4:03:51.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们玩了二三十小时的游戏
Dialogue: 1,4:03:51.73,4:03:57.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩到这里发现游戏竟然让你去杀艾莉 于是拒绝继续玩下去了
Dialogue: 1,4:03:57.16,4:03:59.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这在某种程度上证明了这些角色在玩家心中有着多么重要的地位
Dialogue: 1,4:03:59.49,4:04:04.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这在某种程度上证明了这些角色在玩家心中有着多么重要的地位
Dialogue: 1,4:04:04.13,4:04:07.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们关心他们 我们不希望看到他们遭遇不公
Dialogue: 1,4:04:07.24,4:04:10.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里没有第二种选择感觉真的很难受
Dialogue: 1,4:04:10.15,4:04:16.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,你本来不想打这场仗 原谅艾莉 继续活下去
Dialogue: 1,4:04:16.14,4:04:19.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于手握操控权的玩家来说这本是可以和平解决这场矛盾的光辉时刻
Dialogue: 1,4:04:19.17,4:04:21.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于手握操控权的玩家来说这本是可以和平解决这场矛盾的光辉时刻
Dialogue: 1,4:04:21.76,4:04:25.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对于像这样的线性叙事游戏来说 这种处理并不合适
Dialogue: 1,4:04:25.90,4:04:29.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是 你只能去打这样Boss战
Dialogue: 1,4:04:29.30,4:04:32.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比当前作为主角
Dialogue: 1,4:04:32.02,4:04:34.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,要去追杀艾莉这个反派
Dialogue: 1,4:04:34.74,4:04:36.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里不是在说谁对谁错
Dialogue: 1,4:04:36.91,4:04:42.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为谁是主角谁是反派单纯要看作者的叙事角度
Dialogue: 1,4:04:42.22,4:04:47.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,至于这点游戏设计是否可行 我觉得首先有一个问题
Dialogue: 1,4:04:47.35,4:04:49.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,即每个玩家看法可能是不一样的
Dialogue: 1,4:04:49.45,4:04:52.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,一些玩家可能和埃比和勒弗产生情感上的连接
Dialogue: 1,4:04:52.15,4:04:56.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,在玩了TLOU2后远超与他们与艾莉的连接
Dialogue: 1,4:04:56.17,4:04:57.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 如果你玩过初代游戏
Dialogue: 1,4:04:57.91,4:05:01.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,那你很可能还有很多初代游戏建立起来的情感包袱
Dialogue: 1,4:05:01.79,4:05:03.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,认为艾莉更讨人喜欢
Dialogue: 1,4:05:03.73,4:05:08.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,但可悲的是这代游戏里的艾莉并没有那么令人喜爱
Dialogue: 1,4:05:08.02,4:05:10.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点我在本篇游戏评测中已经提过很多次了
Dialogue: 1,4:05:10.75,4:05:14.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对于我来说 当我意识到游戏在让我做什么的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:05:14.70,4:05:17.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,我呆坐着盯着屏幕愣了一小会
Dialogue: 1,4:05:17.65,4:05:21.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我感觉到这是因为在一周目时 游戏可能并没有完成它的使命
Dialogue: 1,4:05:21.79,4:05:23.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我感觉到这是因为在一周目时 游戏可能并没有完成它的使命
Dialogue: 1,4:05:23.29,4:05:27.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,即顽皮狗希望玩家觉得杀死艾莉是合理的
Dialogue: 1,4:05:27.81,4:05:32.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少应该和艾莉杀死埃比一样合理
Dialogue: 1,4:05:32.50,4:05:35.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我认为游戏并没有做到这点
Dialogue: 1,4:05:35.44,4:05:41.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为艾莉杀死的埃比那边的人实际上都是配角
Dialogue: 1,4:05:41.35,4:05:47.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,欧文？人的确不错 但仍然是配角 而且也不是特别有魅力
Dialogue: 1,4:05:47.05,4:05:49.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然不是一个主导角色
Dialogue: 1,4:05:49.36,4:05:55.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是如果艾莉在勒弗和埃比进入剧院的时候杀死勒弗
Dialogue: 1,4:05:55.06,4:05:57.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得可能剧情导向的效果会更好
Dialogue: 1,4:05:57.85,4:06:00.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样玩家在操控埃比游玩这段的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:06:00.44,4:06:05.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能会感觉追杀艾莉会更加有合理性
Dialogue: 1,4:06:05.68,4:06:08.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 埃比还是在Boss战中追杀艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:06:08.94,4:06:16.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,这场战斗与第一部中冬季篇结束时对抗大家最喜欢的食人魔王的战斗基本相同
Dialogue: 1,4:06:16.39,4:06:19.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,不知道是制作组犯懒 完全复制了战斗内容
Dialogue: 1,4:06:19.03,4:06:24.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是本身就是想让你模仿那场战斗的类似操作
Dialogue: 1,4:06:24.13,4:06:25.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不清楚
Dialogue: 1,4:06:25.12,4:06:31.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,但从它的布局和这场Boss战的结构来看 两者确实惊人地相似
Dialogue: 1,4:06:31.27,4:06:35.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许是巧合 也许是刻意为之 我不确定
Dialogue: 1,4:06:35.68,4:06:39.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,但至少我个人认为是完全相同的战斗
Dialogue: 1,4:06:39.31,4:06:43.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个故事以我所知的所有游戏中观看体验最难受的场景之一收尾
Dialogue: 1,4:06:43.21,4:06:45.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,整个故事以我所知的所有游戏中观看体验最难受的场景之一收尾
Dialogue: 1,4:07:54.67,4:07:58.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,她在勒弗叫住她几秒后停手了
Dialogue: 1,4:07:58.12,4:08:01.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,她意识到这样没有任何帮助
Dialogue: 1,4:08:01.53,4:08:05.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像杀死乔尔并不会让她能够面对父亲的死
Dialogue: 1,4:08:05.77,4:08:09.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,她从父亲去世这件事中解脱的时刻 或者至少是接受的时刻
Dialogue: 1,4:08:09.70,4:08:13.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,是她遇到勒弗和雅拉的那个雨夜
Dialogue: 1,4:08:13.08,4:08:16.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,她发现自己还是可以重新有一个家庭的
Dialogue: 1,4:08:16.36,4:08:21.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,相遇不再是靠恶意与复仇 而是靠爱与和谐
Dialogue: 1,4:08:21.49,4:08:22.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以她放她们走了
Dialogue: 1,4:08:22.90,4:08:28.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比和勒弗离开了 留下艾莉和蒂娜在地板上 血流得到处都是
Dialogue: 1,4:08:28.33,4:08:32.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,画面一黑 来到了游戏最后一个章节
Dialogue: 1,4:08:32.59,4:08:37.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得根本无法形容玩家玩到这里的时候内心感受有多奇怪
Dialogue: 1,4:08:37.99,4:08:43.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,这感觉就像女神躺在你身边结果自己是个太监一样
Dialogue: 1,4:08:43.72,4:08:46.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 说实话我完全不知道该如何评价
Dialogue: 1,4:08:46.63,4:08:48.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,还有不少玩家指出
Dialogue: 1,4:08:48.52,4:08:52.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,这与《荒野大镖客：救赎2》收束结尾的方式很像
Dialogue: 1,4:08:52.57,4:08:56.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,当中亚瑟的死显然是主要故事内容的结尾
Dialogue: 1,4:08:56.65,4:09:02.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后玩家进入了一个似乎很重要 但并不关键的尾声
Dialogue: 1,4:09:02.32,4:09:04.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,事实上我问过我的几个朋友
Dialogue: 1,4:09:04.63,4:09:07.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,在他们看完《荒野大镖客：救赎2》的主线故事后他们是否玩了尾声部分
Dialogue: 1,4:09:07.24,4:09:09.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,在他们看完《荒野大镖客：救赎2》的主线故事后他们是否玩了尾声部分
Dialogue: 1,4:09:09.85,4:09:14.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,你会惊讶地发现他们中有多少人说在亚瑟死后就不玩了
Dialogue: 1,4:09:14.83,4:09:15.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,一方面我能理解他们
Dialogue: 1,4:09:15.94,4:09:18.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,你在游戏的整个过程中一直跟随着那个角色
Dialogue: 1,4:09:18.82,4:09:22.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这个角色的故事似乎已经结束了
Dialogue: 1,4:09:22.12,4:09:24.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你觉得没有必要
Dialogue: 1,4:09:24.41,4:09:30.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,那为何还要继续游玩客观上相对无趣的几个小时的游戏内容呢？
Dialogue: 1,4:09:30.28,4:09:32.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,那为何还要继续游玩客观上相对无趣的几个小时的游戏内容呢？
Dialogue: 1,4:09:32.35,4:09:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,当游戏发布的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:09:33.52,4:09:38.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不禁认为这种把尾声与主线明显分开的决策要么是R星再三考虑下的决策
Dialogue: 1,4:09:38.77,4:09:42.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不禁认为这种把尾声与主线明显分开的决策要么是R星再三考虑下的决策
Dialogue: 1,4:09:42.70,4:09:45.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,要么就是彻底的失误
Dialogue: 1,4:09:45.76,4:09:47.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,对于TLOU2来说
Dialogue: 1,4:09:47.35,4:09:50.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得没法直接比较 但也的确有相似之处
Dialogue: 1,4:09:50.92,4:09:51.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,据我的估计
Dialogue: 1,4:09:51.79,4:09:54.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,绝大多数玩家都希望TLOU2
Dialogue: 1,4:09:54.16,4:09:59.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,结尾能是艾莉和埃比的一段高潮场景
Dialogue: 1,4:09:59.32,4:10:03.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,当中把所有问题都解决掉 最好是一个杀了另一个
Dialogue: 1,4:10:03.28,4:10:05.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者至少有所清算
Dialogue: 1,4:10:05.56,4:10:10.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得游戏这段并没有解决这个问题 满足两人的诉求
Dialogue: 1,4:10:10.51,4:10:15.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,诚然 说埃比明显赢得了这场战斗是没什么争议的
Dialogue: 1,4:10:15.61,4:10:20.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果她想 她轻松就能杀掉艾莉和蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,4:10:20.50,4:10:26.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,但出于内心某种尊严或风度 还有宽恕、自尊等等
Dialogue: 1,4:10:26.86,4:10:29.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论是哪种 她决定放她们一马
Dialogue: 1,4:10:29.95,4:10:33.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此虽然从埃比的角度看 这场冲突可能已经解决了
Dialogue: 1,4:10:33.97,4:10:36.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,她决定继续向前看 想要忘掉这一切
Dialogue: 1,4:10:36.85,4:10:41.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对艾莉、汤米还是蒂娜来说都没有解决
Dialogue: 1,4:10:41.02,4:10:42.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像我们即将看到的场景中那样
Dialogue: 1,4:10:42.97,4:10:45.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得真正令玩家感到沮丧的
Dialogue: 1,4:10:45.24,4:10:50.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,在整个游戏时间内 整个故事一直在为这个时刻、这样的一场战斗做准备
Dialogue: 1,4:10:50.43,4:10:53.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,在整个游戏时间内 整个故事一直在为这个时刻、这样的一场战斗做准备
Dialogue: 1,4:10:53.50,4:10:57.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在我们玩到这里 结果却什么都没解决
Dialogue: 1,4:10:57.04,4:11:01.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,不但没解决 我们还看到艾莉、蒂娜、汤米躺地上浑身是血
Dialogue: 1,4:11:01.51,4:11:04.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰西还领盒饭了
Dialogue: 1,4:11:04.18,4:11:08.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是考虑到玩家游玩这段时情感上已经心力交瘁了
Dialogue: 1,4:11:08.62,4:11:12.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的很难强求玩家再花多少个小时来继续游玩游戏的尾声部分
Dialogue: 1,4:11:12.73,4:11:17.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的很难强求玩家再花多少个小时来继续游玩游戏的尾声部分
Dialogue: 1,4:11:17.32,4:11:22.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我知道理论上这算是尾声 因为故事矛盾根本还没解决
Dialogue: 1,4:11:22.09,4:11:26.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,下一章节仍然属于主线故事的内容
Dialogue: 1,4:11:26.11,4:11:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,但只是看起来和主线故事很割裂
Dialogue: 1,4:11:29.80,4:11:34.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,我思考了很久都不确定顽皮狗是希望如此
Dialogue: 1,4:11:34.63,4:11:40.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者甚至说他们刻意让之后的故事和西雅图的主线内容如此不同
Dialogue: 1,4:11:40.57,4:11:46.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,而有一点是很清楚的 就是在核心游戏内容结束后节奏上的这种急剧转变
Dialogue: 1,4:11:46.09,4:11:51.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,会在很大程度上打击玩家的游戏感受 让他们感受到明显的差异感
Dialogue: 1,4:11:51.52,4:11:53.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多游戏开发者曾在开发者大会、演讲之类的场合提到过
Dialogue: 1,4:11:53.89,4:11:57.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多游戏开发者曾在开发者大会、演讲之类的场合提到过
Dialogue: 1,4:11:57.76,4:12:02.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,在一个项目上连续干很多年后慢慢失去焦点的这种困扰
Dialogue: 1,4:12:02.66,4:12:04.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,在一个项目上连续干很多年后慢慢失去焦点的这种困扰
Dialogue: 1,4:12:04.36,4:12:08.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们会因此忘记第一次玩这个游戏应该是什么样的体验
Dialogue: 1,4:12:08.74,4:12:11.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,换句话说 当你在某个项目上忘我地拼命时
Dialogue: 1,4:12:11.32,4:12:16.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,你的视角就会慢慢缩窄 你会慢慢进入当局者迷的境地
Dialogue: 1,4:12:16.96,4:12:18.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,对你来说可能看起来很棒
Dialogue: 1,4:12:18.61,4:12:21.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,但由于你过于专注于小细节
Dialogue: 1,4:12:21.55,4:12:23.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致丧失了整体上的视野
Dialogue: 1,4:12:23.92,4:12:29.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者反过来 你可能过于专注于全局 结果忽略了细节
Dialogue: 1,4:12:29.09,4:12:33.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,无论怎么说 最后这段战斗都让玩家感觉到了奇怪
Dialogue: 1,4:12:33.09,4:12:34.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少我是这样认为的
Dialogue: 1,4:12:34.48,4:12:37.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,而基于大家很多人在调查中的回复
Dialogue: 1,4:12:37.12,4:12:40.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人也感觉到了奇怪
Dialogue: 1,4:12:40.15,4:12:41.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道你怎样想
Dialogue: 1,4:12:41.41,4:12:45.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,我是感觉太多人有同样想法的话我就会联想到游戏品质问题
Dialogue: 1,4:12:45.97,4:12:50.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,说了这么多 游戏核心内容结束后
Dialogue: 1,4:12:50.21,4:12:53.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家留下了很多悬而未决的问题
Dialogue: 1,4:12:53.02,4:12:55.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如 蒂娜还好吗？
Dialogue: 1,4:12:55.45,4:13:00.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,脑袋咣咣咣砸了那么多下水泥地没事吗？
Dialogue: 1,4:13:00.32,4:13:03.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,不过实际上应该不是水泥地 好像有块木板垫着
Dialogue: 1,4:13:03.99,4:13:07.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样活下来也好解释 细节很棒
Dialogue: 1,4:13:07.54,4:13:08.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们能放几块木板我很欣慰
Dialogue: 1,4:13:08.87,4:13:12.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样颅骨骨折还没死也能解释得通
Dialogue: 1,4:13:12.91,4:13:18.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,但挺着大肚子能活下来也真是命硬
Dialogue: 1,4:13:18.49,4:13:21.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以玩家此时并不知道她会不会有事
Dialogue: 1,4:13:21.52,4:13:24.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,你还想知道 尚未出生的孩子父亲杰西已经死了 那这两人的未来会怎样
Dialogue: 1,4:13:24.64,4:13:27.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,你还想知道 尚未出生的孩子父亲杰西已经死了 那这两人的未来会怎样
Dialogue: 1,4:13:27.79,4:13:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,杰克逊小镇要怎样处理
Dialogue: 1,4:13:29.80,4:13:34.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们的精英小队几乎被州外的一个小团体灭了这件事？
Dialogue: 1,4:13:34.69,4:13:38.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们能、或者会接受此事吗？
Dialogue: 1,4:13:38.35,4:13:40.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们甚至永远不会知道答案
Dialogue: 1,4:13:40.28,4:13:43.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为之后的游戏我们再也没有回到杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,4:13:43.72,4:13:47.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外 可能现在最重要的问题是 艾莉怎么样了？
Dialogue: 1,4:13:47.68,4:13:49.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,她能放下一切吗？
Dialogue: 1,4:13:49.54,4:13:51.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是艾莉想要的结果吗？
Dialogue: 1,4:13:51.58,4:13:54.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是玩家想要的结果吗？
Dialogue: 1,4:13:54.46,4:13:59.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,还是说我们最后还要准备再大干一票 一举了解此事
Dialogue: 1,4:13:59.77,4:14:04.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,拼命为游戏核心内容本身的合理性而辩护？
Dialogue: 1,4:14:04.90,4:14:09.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像《荒野大镖客：救赎2》那样 答案是后者
Dialogue: 1,4:14:09.46,4:14:14.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些问题的答案大多会出现 但现在我们还被蒙在鼓里
Dialogue: 1,4:14:14.60,4:14:18.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,战斗过后的黑场结束后 我们来到一片农场
Dialogue: 1,4:14:18.76,4:14:24.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,有一片广阔的麦田 远处有一座农舍 后面有一个谷仓
Dialogue: 1,4:14:24.19,4:14:25.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,一切宁静如画
Dialogue: 1,4:14:25.96,4:14:27.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,房子里面我们看到了艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:14:27.79,4:14:31.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,她看起来已经痊愈 状况好了不少
Dialogue: 1,4:14:31.36,4:14:36.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,拿着乔尔在第一部作品开头莎拉送给他的手表
Dialogue: 1,4:14:36.07,4:14:41.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏在以一种不那么微妙的方式提醒玩家 艾莉还在惦记着乔尔
Dialogue: 1,4:14:41.74,4:14:43.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,她还没有放下此事
Dialogue: 1,4:14:43.42,4:14:45.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,另外 现在还有个小宝宝了
Dialogue: 1,4:14:45.91,4:14:52.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,这再次证实了自上一场景的事件发生以来已经过去了好长一段时间
Dialogue: 1,4:14:52.03,4:14:54.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,接着我们在厨房见到了蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,4:14:54.04,4:14:56.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来她也恢复得不错
Dialogue: 1,4:14:56.74,4:14:59.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,还穿着家庭主妇一样的裤子
Dialogue: 1,4:14:59.98,4:15:03.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,好吧其实我真不知道那应该叫啥
Dialogue: 1,4:15:03.01,4:15:07.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这个场景我第一眼见到蒂娜就感觉她太有当妈的感觉了
Dialogue: 1,4:15:07.48,4:15:11.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,我也不知道为什么 可能是画了眉毛
Dialogue: 1,4:15:11.20,4:15:15.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,也可能是她奇怪的装束 也可能是因为她在洗碗
Dialogue: 1,4:15:15.10,4:15:16.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不知道怎么回事
Dialogue: 1,4:15:16.93,4:15:21.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们的确成功让蒂娜看上去很像一位妈妈
Dialogue: 1,4:15:21.40,4:15:23.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,这点应该为顽皮狗点赞
Dialogue: 1,4:15:23.05,4:15:26.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且说实话 一切都显得宁静愉快
Dialogue: 1,4:15:26.80,4:15:30.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这个世界里不会有什么幸福的结局
Dialogue: 1,4:15:30.34,4:15:32.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以这当然也不会持续很久
Dialogue: 1,4:15:32.83,4:15:37.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉干了点日常杂活 和蒂娜跳了个舞 玩家参观了一下房间
Dialogue: 1,4:15:37.48,4:15:41.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里有趣的一点是艾莉家里有很多从乔尔家里拿过来的艺术画
Dialogue: 1,4:15:41.77,4:15:43.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里有趣的一点是艾莉家里有很多从乔尔家里拿过来的艺术画
Dialogue: 1,4:15:43.81,4:15:44.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是个很好的提示
Dialogue: 1,4:15:44.74,4:15:47.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,这同样能说明艾莉仍想抓住乔尔的一些影子
Dialogue: 1,4:15:47.89,4:15:50.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像刚刚我们看她在把玩乔尔的手表一样
Dialogue: 1,4:15:50.32,4:15:52.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这方面的细节真的很甜
Dialogue: 1,4:15:52.27,4:15:56.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其是考虑到玩家很可能根本不会注意到这点
Dialogue: 1,4:15:56.38,4:15:58.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少一周目游戏的时候肯定不会
Dialogue: 1,4:15:58.36,4:16:03.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,我发现此事还是因为我为了做这个视频剪辑了很多游戏片段
Dialogue: 1,4:16:03.22,4:16:05.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,反复认真切换场景才发现的
Dialogue: 1,4:16:05.80,4:16:10.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,我先是发现乔尔的房间里有很多好看的挂图 我很喜欢
Dialogue: 1,4:16:10.48,4:16:13.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上这事我在视频前半部分就提到过
Dialogue: 1,4:16:13.99,4:16:18.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,但之后我来到这段场景时 我发现这些画看着很眼熟
Dialogue: 1,4:16:18.59,4:16:23.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,我一开始以为制作者只是在重复使用贴图罢了 这种操作在游戏开发中很常见
Dialogue: 1,4:16:23.11,4:16:26.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,但更进一步的观察后
Dialogue: 1,4:16:26.14,4:16:28.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,我发现这其实是美术设计上的安排
Dialogue: 1,4:16:28.87,4:16:34.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为艾莉一直在想着把乔尔生活中的一些事物带到她的生活中去
Dialogue: 1,4:16:34.00,4:16:36.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 在探索了房子并与蒂娜寒暄了一会儿后
Dialogue: 1,4:16:36.97,4:16:41.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜要艾莉把外面的羊招回谷仓
Dialogue: 1,4:16:41.08,4:16:43.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以艾莉抱着孩子一起去干活
Dialogue: 1,4:16:43.66,4:16:46.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后艾莉发现了一只落单的小羊
Dialogue: 1,4:16:46.60,4:16:50.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,接下来可能是整个游戏里最快速的情绪转变——
Dialogue: 1,4:17:46.48,4:17:50.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真的感觉这一刻吓了玩家一跳 就像艾莉一样
Dialogue: 1,4:17:50.41,4:17:52.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,本来一切是那么轻松愉悦
Dialogue: 1,4:17:52.54,4:17:56.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来她们已经从游戏核心部分的很多烂事中走出来
Dialogue: 1,4:17:56.73,4:17:59.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,过上幸福美满的生活了
Dialogue: 1,4:17:59.86,4:18:02.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,但现在一切都崩塌了
Dialogue: 1,4:18:02.68,4:18:05.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉还是无法忘记乔尔身上发生的一切
Dialogue: 1,4:18:05.98,4:18:09.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,她明显没法放下此事
Dialogue: 1,4:18:09.10,4:18:14.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜也明白此事 并表示理解 因为她知道艾莉自己也无能为力
Dialogue: 1,4:18:14.17,4:18:16.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不是她能控制的
Dialogue: 1,4:18:16.18,4:18:20.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像其他患有类似问题的人无法控制自己的惊恐发作一样
Dialogue: 1,4:18:20.32,4:18:22.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,它就是这样会突然到来
Dialogue: 1,4:18:22.36,4:18:24.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,而游戏还在匆匆继续它的故事
Dialogue: 1,4:18:24.94,4:18:28.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们来到第二天 家里来客人了
Dialogue: 1,4:18:28.42,4:18:29.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,是汤米
Dialogue: 1,4:18:29.26,4:18:32.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,没错 他头部中枪却活下来了
Dialogue: 1,4:18:32.41,4:18:37.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他现在伤还没好利索 甚至连走路都困难
Dialogue: 1,4:18:37.15,4:18:41.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟脑袋中了一枪……可以理解
Dialogue: 1,4:18:41.41,4:18:42.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,显然他身体条件不太好
Dialogue: 1,4:18:42.94,4:18:46.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他对埃比所做的事情还是耿耿于怀
Dialogue: 1,4:18:46.75,4:18:49.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,他说他追踪到埃比在圣塔芭芭拉
Dialogue: 1,4:18:49.93,4:18:51.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在 他虽然没有明说
Dialogue: 1,4:18:51.85,4:18:54.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他自己肯定是去不了了
Dialogue: 1,4:18:54.97,4:18:58.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,毕竟汤米现在走路都不方便 还瞎了一只眼睛
Dialogue: 1,4:18:58.09,4:19:01.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以他就算去也帮不上什么忙
Dialogue: 1,4:19:01.51,4:19:06.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是他找到艾莉帮忙完成他的复仇计划
Dialogue: 1,4:19:06.16,4:19:08.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,最开始看感觉这地方有点牵强
Dialogue: 1,4:19:08.69,4:19:14.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米竟然能追踪到离他的城市那么远的地方的一个人
Dialogue: 1,4:19:14.65,4:19:18.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉和蒂娜显然在杰克逊以外附近某处
Dialogue: 1,4:19:18.67,4:19:22.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以她们俩还在这 只是搬离了小镇的核心区
Dialogue: 1,4:19:22.99,4:19:26.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后我认为这里倒没有最初看来那样牵强
Dialogue: 1,4:19:26.56,4:19:29.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米和火萤组织有着千丝万缕的联系
Dialogue: 1,4:19:29.29,4:19:30.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果你还有印象的话
Dialogue: 1,4:19:30.58,4:19:36.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,欧文说过他想坐船一起和梅尔、埃比、雅拉和勒弗去圣塔芭芭拉
Dialogue: 1,4:19:36.85,4:19:40.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为他认为那边还有大量火萤组织残党
Dialogue: 1,4:19:40.36,4:19:42.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,可以过去投靠他们
Dialogue: 1,4:19:42.57,4:19:46.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,同样的方法 汤米应该也能够追踪到那片区域里带着一个亚裔的某个女性
Dialogue: 1,4:19:46.28,4:19:54.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,同样的方法 汤米应该也能够追踪到那片区域里带着一个亚裔的某个女性
Dialogue: 1,4:19:54.67,4:19:59.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 他们能够追踪她到这一点似乎是相对合理的
Dialogue: 1,4:19:59.14,4:20:05.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,特别是如果让汤米直接对外公告说全境通缉埃比的情况下
Dialogue: 1,4:20:05.05,4:20:06.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,而他显然已经这样做了
Dialogue: 1,4:20:06.25,4:20:11.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而听到他的提议后 艾莉和蒂娜表示强烈反对
Dialogue: 1,4:20:11.95,4:20:13.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们已经放弃这事了
Dialogue: 1,4:20:13.03,4:20:16.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者说至少蒂娜已经放弃了 艾莉还有所挂念
Dialogue: 1,4:20:16.36,4:20:18.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们现在已经失去了太多东西
Dialogue: 1,4:20:18.73,4:20:22.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们有了一个家庭 有了彼此
Dialogue: 1,4:20:22.49,4:20:24.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们曾经尝试过
Dialogue: 1,4:20:24.03,4:20:27.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,上次她们追杀埃比的结果并不好
Dialogue: 1,4:20:27.67,4:20:30.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,汤米在对她们的无动于衷表示愤怒后离开了
Dialogue: 1,4:20:30.91,4:20:33.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,他觉得自己遭到了背叛 甚至还提起艾莉曾对他说会不惜一起代价复仇
Dialogue: 1,4:20:33.75,4:20:37.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,他觉得自己遭到了背叛 甚至还提起艾莉曾对他说会不惜一起代价复仇
Dialogue: 1,4:20:37.99,4:20:43.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种反应倒是能理解 毕竟汤米仍在为他哥哥的死而愤怒
Dialogue: 1,4:20:43.03,4:20:46.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且埃比还给他留下了永久的创伤
Dialogue: 1,4:20:46.48,4:20:52.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,但看到汤米对艾莉如此激烈的反应还是有点令人吃惊
Dialogue: 1,4:20:52.15,4:20:55.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,事实上我甚至想不出汤米在整个TLOU系列里有哪次是以这种态度与人交流的
Dialogue: 1,4:20:55.55,4:21:01.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,事实上我甚至想不出汤米在整个TLOU系列里有哪次是以这种态度与人交流的
Dialogue: 1,4:21:01.12,4:21:06.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,最接近的例子应该是乔尔第一次去汤米的水电站时双方发生点小矛盾的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:21:06.76,4:21:08.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,最接近的例子应该是乔尔第一次去汤米的水电站时双方发生点小矛盾的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:21:08.80,4:21:12.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,但那也没这次这样激烈、直接
Dialogue: 1,4:21:12.16,4:21:17.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜拉汤米出去说 俩人在外面吵了一会
Dialogue: 1,4:21:17.11,4:21:19.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,声音大到屋里的艾莉都能听见
Dialogue: 1,4:21:19.81,4:21:22.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,但艾莉还是被卷入了进来
Dialogue: 1,4:21:22.72,4:21:27.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,她明白蒂娜不同意她去找埃比了结此事
Dialogue: 1,4:21:27.61,4:21:30.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她还是惦记这件事
Dialogue: 1,4:21:30.31,4:21:31.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上 接下来的场景
Dialogue: 1,4:21:31.75,4:21:34.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们就看到艾莉深夜在家中踱步
Dialogue: 1,4:21:34.93,4:21:37.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,她夜不能寐 辗转反侧
Dialogue: 1,4:21:37.72,4:21:41.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,她想复仇 但又知道这可能让她失去一切
Dialogue: 1,4:21:41.53,4:21:45.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,她用乔尔的旧吉他弹着小调 想让自己忘掉一切
Dialogue: 1,4:21:45.70,4:21:47.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这看上去没有一点用处
Dialogue: 1,4:21:47.74,4:21:50.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上 这反而让一切变得更糟
Dialogue: 1,4:21:50.32,4:21:53.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,镜头接着来到了杰克逊小镇的冬季舞会
Dialogue: 1,4:21:53.16,4:21:56.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段我们之前只在言语中讨论过的场景
Dialogue: 1,4:21:56.32,4:21:59.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,内容和发售前的预告片一样
Dialogue: 1,4:21:59.62,4:22:04.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这次我们知道了游戏开头艾莉说的那件事
Dialogue: 1,4:22:04.33,4:22:09.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,在预告片的内容——艾莉和蒂娜亲吻了彼此之后
Dialogue: 1,4:22:09.16,4:22:13.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,一位长者对二人的亲吻行为说了一些不好听的话
Dialogue: 1,4:22:13.08,4:22:17.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔上来推了他一把 让艾莉不知为何很不高兴
Dialogue: 1,4:22:17.62,4:22:23.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能因为她觉得乔尔又一次插手了本来属于她自己的事情
Dialogue: 1,4:22:23.23,4:22:25.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,不要急 我们稍后会说到此事
Dialogue: 1,4:22:25.66,4:22:30.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是回到现在 艾莉下定决心去追杀埃比
Dialogue: 1,4:22:30.44,4:22:32.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,这次要让一切做个了结
Dialogue: 1,4:22:32.62,4:22:36.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,也许是她想起了与那个偏执的老人对峙的事情
Dialogue: 1,4:22:36.34,4:22:40.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,她明白她应该为属于她自己的事情去战斗
Dialogue: 1,4:22:40.27,4:22:42.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,否则她将永远无法为自己而活
Dialogue: 1,4:22:42.34,4:22:45.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这次 她的离开不是抛下杰克逊小镇那么简单了
Dialogue: 1,4:22:45.82,4:22:50.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,她在抛弃她辛苦建立的整个家庭
Dialogue: 1,4:22:50.14,4:22:53.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里我再一次感到很难去同情艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:22:53.62,4:22:55.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其我觉得很多人会希望
Dialogue: 1,4:22:55.98,4:23:00.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,她应该放下这一切 不要再去找埃比了
Dialogue: 1,4:23:00.07,4:23:04.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,和我聊过艾莉最后这个抛弃一切、要去再次追杀埃比的决定的每一个人
Dialogue: 1,4:23:04.42,4:23:07.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,和我聊过艾莉最后这个抛弃一切、要去再次追杀埃比的决定的每一个人
Dialogue: 1,4:23:07.56,4:23:12.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,都说这是一个错误的决定 都不想艾莉这样做
Dialogue: 1,4:23:12.31,4:23:15.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们希望她能原谅埃比 继续生活下去
Dialogue: 1,4:23:15.55,4:23:20.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,这又是一个在情感上令人感到心力交瘁的安排
Dialogue: 1,4:23:20.26,4:23:23.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为当你不同意角色所做事情的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:23:23.80,4:23:25.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,你就会对角色失去同情心
Dialogue: 1,4:23:25.90,4:23:29.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,使得你更难同情其所经历的一切
Dialogue: 1,4:23:29.98,4:23:32.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉收拾东西的时候 蒂娜发现了她
Dialogue: 1,4:23:32.89,4:23:35.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜很清楚艾莉一直在想这件事
Dialogue: 1,4:23:35.61,4:23:38.89,辉中,,0,0,0,,但看到她真的付诸实践还是很害怕
Dialogue: 1,4:23:38.89,4:23:40.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜恳求她回来继续睡觉
Dialogue: 1,4:23:40.51,4:23:45.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,恳求她放下这件事 忘掉这一切 不要抛弃她的家庭 不要去复仇
Dialogue: 1,4:23:45.52,4:23:48.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,但艾莉说她别无选择 只能这样做
Dialogue: 1,4:23:48.61,4:23:52.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜明确表示自己不会再去干这样的事了
Dialogue: 1,4:23:52.81,4:23:54.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,她不会和艾莉一起去
Dialogue: 1,4:23:54.49,4:23:58.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果艾莉决定这对她来说是最重要的
Dialogue: 1,4:23:58.06,4:24:04.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,那等她活着回家就甭想再去找蒂娜和孩子了
Dialogue: 1,4:24:04.63,4:24:07.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,她实际上是在给艾莉下最后通牒
Dialogue: 1,4:24:07.39,4:24:09.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,去找埃比 或者和蒂娜留下来
Dialogue: 1,4:24:09.94,4:24:13.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,留在这个她亲手建立起的整个家庭里
Dialogue: 1,4:24:13.78,4:24:15.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉选择了前者
Dialogue: 1,4:24:15.38,4:24:20.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,她再一次让玩家感觉她一点都不可怜
Dialogue: 1,4:24:20.84,4:24:25.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,——她会失去蒂娜 以及接下来几小时游戏中她将遇到的所有痛苦
Dialogue: 1,4:24:25.18,4:24:27.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,——她会失去蒂娜 以及接下来几小时游戏中她将遇到的所有痛苦
Dialogue: 1,4:24:27.49,4:24:30.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是艾莉离开了 留下了悲痛的蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,4:24:30.97,4:24:33.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗在这玩了个假动作
Dialogue: 1,4:24:33.18,4:24:34.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,画面给到加利福尼亚
Dialogue: 1,4:24:34.54,4:24:38.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,景色和之前完全不同 一切都很干燥、死寂
Dialogue: 1,4:24:38.50,4:24:42.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,本章开篇镜头给到一双帆布鞋
Dialogue: 1,4:24:42.10,4:24:45.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩过一代游戏的都知道这肯定是艾莉标志性的打扮
Dialogue: 1,4:24:45.97,4:24:47.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果镜头一拉远
Dialogue: 1,4:24:47.62,4:24:52.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果发现竟然是勒弗 旁边和他一起走的是埃比
Dialogue: 1,4:24:52.27,4:24:54.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在这对我来说有点明显
Dialogue: 1,4:24:54.13,4:24:59.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这显然是在为埃比和乔尔以及艾莉和勒弗之间的平行关系做铺垫
Dialogue: 1,4:24:59.74,4:25:04.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这种平行关系的类比是否合理取决于你
Dialogue: 1,4:25:04.24,4:25:06.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这显示就是编剧想表达的内容
Dialogue: 1,4:25:06.43,4:25:08.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉的帆布鞋是她的标志
Dialogue: 1,4:25:08.20,4:25:12.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,这就是她在第一部作品中的标准打扮之一
Dialogue: 1,4:25:12.31,4:25:14.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至在本作大部分时间里也是如此
Dialogue: 1,4:25:14.35,4:25:20.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,如此明确地向玩家展示这双鞋 就是在向玩家明示两组人的平行关系
Dialogue: 1,4:25:20.92,4:25:23.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,现在埃比和勒弗在寻找火萤组织
Dialogue: 1,4:25:23.16,4:25:25.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,希望能找到一个他们可以归属的新的大家庭
Dialogue: 1,4:25:25.56,4:25:29.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,还记得欧文之前提到的圣塔芭芭拉吧
Dialogue: 1,4:25:29.80,4:25:33.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们得到线索说在圣塔芭芭拉的康斯坦斯街2425号
Dialogue: 1,4:25:33.93,4:25:36.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,有一个火萤组织网络的地下据点
Dialogue: 1,4:25:36.97,4:25:40.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此在埃比和勒弗解决几个感染者之后
Dialogue: 1,4:25:40.87,4:25:42.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们终于来到了这座房子的地下室
Dialogue: 1,4:25:42.88,4:25:44.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,并发现了无线电装置
Dialogue: 1,4:25:44.92,4:25:47.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,一番尝试后 他们终于联系上了某人
Dialogue: 1,4:25:47.59,4:25:52.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,看起来埃比和勒弗终于找到了新家 终于安全了
Dialogue: 1,4:25:52.69,4:25:55.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,拉倒吧 悲剧很快就到你家门口
Dialogue: 1,4:25:55.78,4:26:01.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,哪有什么美满结局 准备好吧 坏事要来了
Dialogue: 1,4:26:01.45,4:26:05.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是两人确定了一个会合点 他们将前往那里与火萤组织会合
Dialogue: 1,4:26:05.47,4:26:06.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,当两人离开房子的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:26:06.70,4:26:10.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,一个小团伙在门口把他们截住了
Dialogue: 1,4:26:10.78,4:26:13.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,这些人似乎正在进行某种奴隶贸易
Dialogue: 1,4:26:13.57,4:26:17.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,说实话 游戏玩了这么久才出现这种组织挺令我惊讶的
Dialogue: 1,4:26:17.50,4:26:20.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人被揍了一顿 捆上 然后被带走了
Dialogue: 1,4:26:20.17,4:26:25.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,可能会卖身为奴 当劳工去了
Dialogue: 1,4:26:25.39,4:26:27.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,画面来到艾莉 她很快就跟上来了
Dialogue: 1,4:26:27.88,4:26:30.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,她发现了他们的船就扎在那
Dialogue: 1,4:26:30.72,4:26:34.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,船上还找到一张地图 上面圈起了康斯坦斯街2425号这个地方
Dialogue: 1,4:26:34.15,4:26:36.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,你一路推进穿越各种街道和房屋
Dialogue: 1,4:26:36.94,4:26:40.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里是整部游戏里最后一次和感染者的战斗了
Dialogue: 1,4:26:40.24,4:26:41.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,好好享受吧
Dialogue: 1,4:26:41.36,4:26:45.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为之后顽皮狗安排的战斗将是完全和人类敌人作战
Dialogue: 1,4:26:45.46,4:26:49.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,只不过有个小例外 这点之后会提到
Dialogue: 1,4:26:49.09,4:26:52.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 这之后会有很多很多人类敌人就是了
Dialogue: 1,4:26:52.03,4:26:55.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉继续在街坊里推进 爬下一座小丘
Dialogue: 1,4:26:55.84,4:26:56.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后……
Dialogue: 1,4:28:59.56,4:29:02.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,俩人唠着唠着就白给了
Dialogue: 1,4:29:02.17,4:29:07.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,而作为玩家 你应该经常问自己 你玩游戏的动力何在？
Dialogue: 1,4:29:07.16,4:29:12.22,辉中,,0,0,0,,不是说游戏让你干啥你就干啥 就叫有游戏动力了
Dialogue: 1,4:29:12.22,4:29:15.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,TLOU2前几个小时很不错的一点就是
Dialogue: 1,4:29:15.02,4:29:21.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家会完全体会到艾莉的想法 和她一样想找埃比复仇
Dialogue: 1,4:29:21.34,4:29:22.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,而随着游戏的进行
Dialogue: 1,4:29:22.54,4:29:28.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,你也会随着自己开始同情埃比和她的伙伴而开始慢慢失去这样的动力
Dialogue: 1,4:29:28.06,4:29:31.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以在那场Boss战中你会感觉内心非常矛盾
Dialogue: 1,4:29:31.15,4:29:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,你什么都不想做 哪个角色也不想伤害
Dialogue: 1,4:29:34.66,4:29:37.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,而现在玩家的感觉还是那样
Dialogue: 1,4:29:37.48,4:29:41.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏设计者让你操控艾莉继续追杀埃比
Dialogue: 1,4:29:41.44,4:29:44.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,尽管此时她已经为此失去了一切
Dialogue: 1,4:29:44.68,4:29:48.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且很可能不会得到玩家或者艾莉都满意的结果
Dialogue: 1,4:29:48.46,4:29:51.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且很可能不会得到玩家或者艾莉都满意的结果
Dialogue: 1,4:29:51.64,4:29:53.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,一些玩家认为这属于游戏节奏把控问题
Dialogue: 1,4:29:53.83,4:29:56.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这样讲不太恰当
Dialogue: 1,4:29:56.44,4:29:59.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,真要说的话 我觉得这是游戏动力上的问题
Dialogue: 1,4:29:59.17,4:30:05.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得玩家在玩这关的时候会感觉没有继续做游戏要求的事情的动力
Dialogue: 1,4:30:05.59,4:30:11.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,当然 有很多游戏就是让玩家单纯跟着游玩内容去走的
Dialogue: 1,4:30:11.14,4:30:14.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,不用去管任何叙事的内容
Dialogue: 1,4:30:14.32,4:30:17.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,但顽皮狗的游戏不是这样的
Dialogue: 1,4:30:17.29,4:30:23.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗的游戏完全都是靠叙事来推动玩家继续游玩下去的
Dialogue: 1,4:30:23.77,4:30:27.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我说实话 我看这里做得如此平平无奇感觉实在糟糕
Dialogue: 1,4:30:27.32,4:30:29.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这里本应是游戏高潮所在
Dialogue: 1,4:30:29.62,4:30:32.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果却是这种单调乏味的任务
Dialogue: 1,4:30:32.95,4:30:37.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为玩家认为艾莉的行为是完全不合理的
Dialogue: 1,4:30:37.09,4:30:40.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,甚至艾莉也因自己的决定而感到纠结
Dialogue: 1,4:30:40.81,4:30:45.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉还继续想着复仇 因为她觉得自己对乔尔有一份责任
Dialogue: 1,4:30:45.49,4:30:48.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,这份责任稍后就会解释
Dialogue: 1,4:30:48.73,4:30:54.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,说是这样说 玩家还是继续推进到一个叫“度假村”的奴隶贩子营地
Dialogue: 1,4:30:54.46,4:30:56.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这不是什么故意搞笑的名字
Dialogue: 1,4:30:56.44,4:31:01.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是这地方以前是个度假区 所以就这样叫了 就这么简单
Dialogue: 1,4:31:01.85,4:31:05.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里可以解锁整个游戏里我最喜欢的枪
Dialogue: 1,4:31:05.44,4:31:10.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,但它实在是太强了 完全不需要有手就能玩
Dialogue: 1,4:31:10.99,4:31:12.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,有了这把逆天武器
Dialogue: 1,4:31:12.97,4:31:17.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,你一路杀到了度假区里关着奴隶的主体建筑里
Dialogue: 1,4:31:17.62,4:31:20.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,说实话 这这关做得真挺烂
Dialogue: 1,4:31:20.23,4:31:24.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其想到这都已经是游戏里的结尾部分了
Dialogue: 1,4:31:24.55,4:31:30.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,这已经是除了最终boss“战”以外的最后一场战斗内容了
Dialogue: 1,4:31:30.76,4:31:33.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,无趣到令人咂舌
Dialogue: 1,4:31:33.10,4:31:35.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,要说唯一有意思的点
Dialogue: 1,4:31:35.32,4:31:40.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,就是几个被锁链固定住的感染者了 可以把它们放了去咬敌人
Dialogue: 1,4:31:40.36,4:31:43.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,但除此之外 这关就真没什么有意思的内容了
Dialogue: 1,4:31:43.57,4:31:47.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,而即使你可以解开感染者的锁链
Dialogue: 1,4:31:47.17,4:31:50.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,让它们去攻击其他人类敌人
Dialogue: 1,4:31:50.48,4:31:56.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,那么如果人类敌人没有杀光感染者 你就得在感染者发现你之前解决它们
Dialogue: 1,4:31:56.77,4:32:00.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以游戏内容本身并没啥特别新奇不同的地方
Dialogue: 1,4:32:00.61,4:32:02.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是空洞的杀杀杀
Dialogue: 1,4:32:02.61,4:32:06.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且很不幸的是这里本应是游戏的高潮
Dialogue: 1,4:32:06.31,4:32:09.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果却是这样平平无奇
Dialogue: 1,4:32:09.28,4:32:10.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,看到这样的内容我还是挺惊讶的
Dialogue: 1,4:32:10.82,4:32:14.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为通常顽皮狗是很擅长抓住游戏重点的
Dialogue: 1,4:32:14.05,4:32:18.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们会在游戏结尾部分有各种天马行空的关卡
Dialogue: 1,4:32:18.31,4:32:21.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,不管是《神海》系列还是上一代的TLOU
Dialogue: 1,4:32:21.88,4:32:25.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们真的会把游戏的难度拉满
Dialogue: 1,4:32:25.27,4:32:27.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,到这个游戏里却不那样了
Dialogue: 1,4:32:27.64,4:32:32.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,即便如此 艾莉在杀了无数奴隶主后 还是找到了去沙滩的路
Dialogue: 1,4:32:32.17,4:32:34.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,几个被关起来的人告诉她
Dialogue: 1,4:32:34.04,4:32:38.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里就是埃比和勒弗在试图逃跑后被带到的地方
Dialogue: 1,4:32:38.26,4:32:41.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,通常奴隶们会被带到这吊起来直到死
Dialogue: 1,4:32:41.74,4:32:44.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,我得说到海滩之后这画面挺离谱的
Dialogue: 1,4:32:44.96,4:32:47.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉看到的画面很令人不适
Dialogue: 1,4:33:08.20,4:33:12.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,这里其实有个迷惑选项 就是这个有辫子的女孩
Dialogue: 1,4:33:12.55,4:33:16.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,她看着很像埃比 尤其像我们上次见到她的样子
Dialogue: 1,4:33:16.42,4:33:18.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她并不是埃比
Dialogue: 1,4:33:18.60,4:33:21.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,真正的埃比其实你刚刚从她身边走过
Dialogue: 1,4:33:21.81,4:33:24.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,她瘦得不成样子
Dialogue: 1,4:33:39.17,4:33:42.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 看着像变了一个人一样
Dialogue: 1,4:33:42.46,4:33:46.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比还花了一点时间才反应过来面前的是艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:33:46.06,4:33:48.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,但她完全没力气打架了
Dialogue: 1,4:33:48.37,4:33:52.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,实际上 艾莉放下她之后 她就马上去救勒弗了
Dialogue: 1,4:33:52.66,4:33:56.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,之后她拖着虚弱的身子抱着勒弗走向远方
Dialogue: 1,4:33:56.68,4:34:02.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,三人来到了每次打开游戏就能看到的那条船旁边
Dialogue: 1,4:34:02.95,4:34:07.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使到了现在 埃比也还一直在关心勒弗
Dialogue: 1,4:34:07.06,4:34:09.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,确保他们能逃到安全的地方
Dialogue: 1,4:34:09.94,4:34:13.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,她还带艾莉来到了船边 帮助她逃离此处
Dialogue: 1,4:34:13.33,4:34:20.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,我知道艾莉是来杀她并实施最初的报仇的
Dialogue: 1,4:34:20.32,4:34:25.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,据我们所知 埃比应该以为艾莉也被抓去当奴隶
Dialogue: 1,4:34:25.39,4:34:27.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后逃跑到这里来的
Dialogue: 1,4:34:27.34,4:34:29.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,但无论如何
Dialogue: 1,4:34:29.08,4:34:31.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比走到船边
Dialogue: 1,4:34:31.52,4:34:36.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉身上还有树枝的刺伤
Dialogue: 1,4:34:36.04,4:34:40.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,埃比则是经历了几周、几个月的折磨
Dialogue: 1,4:34:40.41,4:34:46.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,在最后一刻 她们不得不在痛苦中进行这场最后的决战
Dialogue: 1,4:34:46.27,4:34:50.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉想要和埃比决斗 了结这一切
Dialogue: 1,4:34:50.31,4:34:55.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,她甚至拿她的弹簧刀威胁说如果埃比不和她打就杀死勒弗
Dialogue: 1,4:34:55.48,4:34:57.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以埃比别无选择
Dialogue: 1,4:34:57.79,4:35:03.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,只能和艾莉打 不为她自己 也不是为了艾莉 而是为了勒弗
Dialogue: 1,4:35:03.67,4:35:07.90,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果这段战斗给刚玩游戏的玩家看
Dialogue: 1,4:35:07.90,4:35:10.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们可能会感觉很爽
Dialogue: 1,4:35:10.45,4:35:16.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,对玩家来说 把杀死乔尔的人砍成碎片的感觉很愉悦
Dialogue: 1,4:35:16.66,4:35:20.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,但现在恰恰相反 感觉很糟糕、很可悲
Dialogue: 1,4:35:20.95,4:35:25.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,我没有感觉到任何像是报应、或是正义之类的东西
Dialogue: 1,4:35:25.06,4:35:29.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,真要说的话 这只能是游戏的叙事起作用了
Dialogue: 1,4:35:29.50,4:35:33.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏的故事真的让我从想找杀死乔尔的凶手报仇
Dialogue: 1,4:35:33.67,4:35:36.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,变成想原谅她、想继续前进下去了
Dialogue: 1,4:35:36.43,4:35:38.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,简单 但又有力
Dialogue: 1,4:35:38.74,4:35:44.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,随着这场战斗的继续 我唯一祈求的就是她们能停下来
Dialogue: 1,4:35:44.83,4:35:46.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,但战斗仍在继续
Dialogue: 1,4:35:46.78,4:35:51.88,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人都变得逐渐虚弱 直到战斗到了这必然的结局
Dialogue: 1,4:38:10.57,4:38:12.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我们回到了农场的房子
Dialogue: 1,4:38:12.52,4:38:17.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,看上去已经过了好一阵 一切都显得荒凉不堪
Dialogue: 1,4:38:17.02,4:38:21.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,房子里空荡荡的 外墙漆也剥落了 木材也变形了
Dialogue: 1,4:38:21.50,4:38:24.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,这一些都在告诉你 蒂娜已经和孩子搬走了
Dialogue: 1,4:38:24.72,4:38:26.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉现在孤身一人了
Dialogue: 1,4:38:26.50,4:38:30.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,总之 这里已经很久没人来过了
Dialogue: 1,4:38:30.10,4:38:33.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是虽然现在艾莉看起来已经孤身一人
Dialogue: 1,4:38:33.87,4:38:40.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且她的行为造成的后果也比失去几根手指要严重得多
Dialogue: 1,4:38:40.96,4:38:42.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得事情没那么简单
Dialogue: 1,4:38:42.76,4:38:46.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,相反 实际上我觉得这可能是比乍看起来更美好的结局
Dialogue: 1,4:38:46.78,4:38:48.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我们之后会细讲这件事
Dialogue: 1,4:38:48.82,4:38:50.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉走进空荡荡的房子
Dialogue: 1,4:38:50.65,4:38:55.30,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终来到应该是堆放艾莉旧物的房间
Dialogue: 1,4:38:55.30,4:38:58.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,还有很多房子里整理来的乔尔的物品
Dialogue: 1,4:38:58.66,4:39:00.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,她拿起乔尔的吉他
Dialogue: 1,4:39:00.52,4:39:06.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,蹩脚地弹起了乔尔在开场给她弹的那首歌
Dialogue: 1,4:39:06.04,4:39:12.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,她那几根缺失的手指 现在成了她和乔尔之间再也无法触及的距离
Dialogue: 1,4:39:12.16,4:39:14.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人的那份联系已荡然无存
Dialogue: 1,4:39:14.84,4:39:18.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,她甚至无法完整正确地弹出那首曲子了
Dialogue: 1,4:39:18.52,4:39:21.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后来到了整个游戏中最重要的画面
Dialogue: 1,4:39:21.61,4:39:26.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,一幅我花了几周字斟句酌也无法形容的场景
Dialogue: 1,4:39:26.62,4:39:28.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我还是直接放给大家看吧
Dialogue: 1,4:45:32.17,4:45:34.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏就这样结束了
Dialogue: 1,4:45:34.87,4:45:38.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,和游戏开场时的镜头一样
Dialogue: 1,4:45:38.37,4:45:41.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,那时镜头聚焦在乔尔正在清洁的吉他
Dialogue: 1,4:45:41.98,4:45:46.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,一边清洁一边描述一代作品结尾在医院发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,4:45:46.09,4:45:50.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,而游戏结尾则是艾莉将如何尝试去原谅乔尔
Dialogue: 1,4:45:50.85,4:45:54.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,并度过未来没有乔尔的每个漫漫长夜
Dialogue: 1,4:45:54.04,4:45:57.73,辉中,,0,0,0,,这段结尾也让玩家恍然大悟
Dialogue: 1,4:45:57.73,4:45:59.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是为什么在视频开头
Dialogue: 1,4:45:59.86,4:46:05.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我跟大家讲过 艾莉晚上要和乔尔看电影这件事是何其重要
Dialogue: 1,4:46:05.92,4:46:09.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为这将是两人重新建立感情的第一步
Dialogue: 1,4:46:09.04,4:46:11.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们本打算冰释前嫌
Dialogue: 1,4:46:11.38,4:46:15.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是为什么艾莉在失去乔尔后会如此悲痛欲绝
Dialogue: 1,4:46:15.10,4:46:18.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为那晚她本该迈出与乔尔和好的第一步
Dialogue: 1,4:46:18.37,4:46:19.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,但是看起来
Dialogue: 1,4:46:19.45,4:46:22.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,在经过所有的沉思 所有的紧张
Dialogue: 1,4:46:22.72,4:46:27.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,所有的压力 所有几个月来积累起来的仇恨过后
Dialogue: 1,4:46:27.94,4:46:31.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,以及此时 经历了多年因失去乔尔所带来的痛苦后
Dialogue: 1,4:46:31.84,4:46:40.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉意识到战胜这种悲伤的最好方式就是接受乔尔的离去 继续快乐地生活
Dialogue: 1,4:46:40.60,4:46:42.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,不是去整天寻求报仇
Dialogue: 1,4:46:42.40,4:46:47.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是与像乔尔一样爱她、在意她的人一起好好生活下去
Dialogue: 1,4:46:47.74,4:46:54.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,这样 她才能将她这份感受到的爱继续实践、传递下去
Dialogue: 1,4:46:54.79,4:46:57.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,随着艾莉慢慢走远
Dialogue: 1,4:46:57.13,4:47:02.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,她终于放下了这一切 放下了所有乔尔留给她的物品
Dialogue: 1,4:47:02.95,4:47:04.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,她学会了往前看
Dialogue: 1,4:47:04.87,4:47:08.77,辉中,,0,0,0,,在经历了如此漫长的旅途过后
Dialogue: 1,4:47:08.77,4:47:13.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔和艾莉的故事 终于结束了
Dialogue: 1,4:47:13.48,4:47:16.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,就这样 游戏结束了
Dialogue: 1,4:47:16.69,4:47:23.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 我在看结尾制作人员名单的时候我的思路完全是迷茫的
Dialogue: 1,4:47:24.84,4:47:30.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得总结这一切的最好方式就是与你们交谈
Dialogue: 1,4:47:30.01,4:47:34.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,面对面不打草稿地交流 一边唠嗑一边总结
Dialogue: 1,4:47:34.39,4:47:37.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我觉得这个游戏太非同寻常了
Dialogue: 1,4:47:37.85,4:47:41.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的是字面意义上的 超乎大家对游戏认知的非同寻常
Dialogue: 1,4:47:41.83,4:47:43.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,绝大多数游戏你可以轻松给出好评或者差评
Dialogue: 1,4:47:43.93,4:47:45.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,你可以说它很好 也可以说它很烂
Dialogue: 1,4:47:45.70,4:47:49.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我认为TLOU2是一款非常非常好的游戏
Dialogue: 1,4:47:49.45,4:47:52.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为游戏性上体验很棒
Dialogue: 1,4:47:52.45,4:47:56.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,除了一点节奏问题外 大部分内容做得很好
Dialogue: 1,4:47:56.53,4:48:02.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,但其中很多节奏上的问题主要是由叙事引起的
Dialogue: 1,4:48:02.61,4:48:07.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为你又想专注于一个角色 又要在两个角色之间不断交换
Dialogue: 1,4:48:07.12,4:48:09.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,同时还有一些其他游戏内容上的节奏问题
Dialogue: 1,4:48:09.46,4:48:14.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如游戏高潮内容的构建
Dialogue: 1,4:48:14.39,4:48:19.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,最终Boss战的沉浸感和有趣程度的方面是有问题的
Dialogue: 1,4:48:19.87,4:48:25.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,但对于游玩部分来讲 它仍然是个好游戏
Dialogue: 1,4:48:25.37,4:48:28.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多对TLOU2不满的人
Dialogue: 1,4:48:28.63,4:48:31.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,也并不会否认这方面的问题
Dialogue: 1,4:48:31.24,4:48:35.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以许多批评内容并不是指向这里的
Dialogue: 1,4:48:35.98,4:48:39.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我发现我们很多人的批评最后都来自于……
Dialogue: 1,4:48:40.51,4:48:44.23,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗对于剧情方向上做出的选择
Dialogue: 1,4:48:45.19,4:48:47.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为编剧们当然是有很多选择的
Dialogue: 1,4:48:47.80,4:48:50.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不需要非得做出某些选择
Dialogue: 1,4:48:50.35,4:48:52.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不用非得让乔尔领便当
Dialogue: 1,4:48:52.36,4:48:55.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不用非得让你和埃比产生共鸣
Dialogue: 1,4:48:55.93,4:49:00.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们不用非得让你在游戏后半去操控埃比
Dialogue: 1,4:49:00.70,4:49:02.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多都不是一定这样做才行的
Dialogue: 1,4:49:02.17,4:49:04.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们还是选择这样做了
Dialogue: 1,4:49:04.03,4:49:06.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我自己也能看得出
Dialogue: 1,4:49:06.25,4:49:13.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多玩家最开始都以为、都期待游戏是完全关于艾莉的
Dialogue: 1,4:49:13.15,4:49:14.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,确实如此
Dialogue: 1,4:49:14.56,4:49:19.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们并不想去认识新的角色
Dialogue: 1,4:49:20.20,4:49:23.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想这正是大家的困扰所在
Dialogue: 1,4:49:23.76,4:49:26.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,许多玩家都期待着
Dialogue: 1,4:49:26.96,4:49:34.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,能够有更多和艾莉在一起的 不只是悲伤与绝望的经历
Dialogue: 1,4:49:34.03,4:49:41.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,结果却发现玩家要陪着艾莉一起经历这种令人沮丧到心累的漫漫旅程
Dialogue: 1,4:49:41.35,4:49:43.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这正是我的观点的落脚点
Dialogue: 1,4:49:43.75,4:49:48.97,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我真的非常非常喜爱艾莉这个角色 我关心她
Dialogue: 1,4:49:48.97,4:49:50.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得我和她产生了很深的羁绊
Dialogue: 1,4:49:50.64,4:49:53.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,我之前都没想到我会和一个游戏中的角色产生这种联系
Dialogue: 1,4:49:53.74,4:49:58.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,而她在第二部作品中的表现也是在实在让人心疼不起来
Dialogue: 1,4:49:58.66,4:50:02.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为客观来看她的行为很愚蠢
Dialogue: 1,4:50:02.04,4:50:05.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,丝毫不为她自己和周围的人着想
Dialogue: 1,4:50:05.95,4:50:08.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,她做的事情相当自私
Dialogue: 1,4:50:08.47,4:50:14.98,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且她对继续进行乔尔的复仇之旅有……有一种执念
Dialogue: 1,4:50:14.98,4:50:20.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,但要注意 这和前作里乔尔的行为是不同的
Dialogue: 1,4:50:20.59,4:50:22.07,辉中,,0,0,0,,乔尔去救艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:50:22.07,4:50:29.28,辉中,,0,0,0,,把她从火萤组织手里救出来的时候同样也杀了很多人
Dialogue: 1,4:50:29.28,4:50:32.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少大家能够明白乔尔在做什么 甚至会认同他的做法
Dialogue: 1,4:50:32.70,4:50:34.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为大家也很爱艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:50:34.27,4:50:36.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,玩家可能会说自己太关心艾莉了
Dialogue: 1,4:50:36.49,4:50:39.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,换我是乔尔 我也会做同样的事
Dialogue: 1,4:50:39.39,4:50:43.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,而在这个游戏中操控艾莉的时候 很多次我都在跟自己说
Dialogue: 1,4:50:43.67,4:50:47.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,“我肯定不会这样做”“这是错误的”“我可不敢苟同”
Dialogue: 1,4:50:47.44,4:50:50.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,正因为我关心艾莉 所以我才不同意她的行为
Dialogue: 1,4:50:50.53,4:50:55.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,她整个游戏都在进行自我毁灭、边缘人格化的、自杀式的任务
Dialogue: 1,4:50:55.93,4:50:59.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,这让人很难同情她 甚至根本不会同情她
Dialogue: 1,4:51:00.40,4:51:02.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,而当你不同情某个人的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:51:02.95,4:51:05.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,和那个人产生不了情感上的羁绊就不奇怪了
Dialogue: 1,4:51:05.53,4:51:07.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,也因此 对于很多人来说
Dialogue: 1,4:51:07.33,4:51:12.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们觉得自己玩的不是一款《最后生还者》游戏 甚至可以说它本身就不是
Dialogue: 1,4:51:12.76,4:51:16.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,这算不上是续作 而是一个独立出来的故事
Dialogue: 1,4:51:16.63,4:51:18.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉已经长大了 已经不是之前那个她了
Dialogue: 1,4:51:18.85,4:51:23.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,已经无法与第一部里那个她相提并论了
Dialogue: 1,4:51:23.50,4:51:27.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以顽皮狗才一直插入闪回剧情
Dialogue: 1,4:51:27.04,4:51:30.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,不断提醒大家 原来的艾莉是什么样的
Dialogue: 1,4:51:31.30,4:51:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,但那是不够的 因为你主要玩的还是当前的时间线
Dialogue: 1,4:51:34.66,4:51:39.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果当前时间线的艾莉不好玩 不值得同情 那你就不会关心她
Dialogue: 1,4:51:39.55,4:51:41.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,你就是不会关心她
Dialogue: 1,4:51:41.08,4:51:43.51,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是问题来了
Dialogue: 1,4:51:43.51,4:51:47.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉这个人物在本作中描写得够好吗？
Dialogue: 1,4:51:47.86,4:51:50.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为就他们想要讲述的故事而言 写得很好
Dialogue: 1,4:51:50.95,4:51:53.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个角色达成了顽皮狗的目的
Dialogue: 1,4:51:53.94,4:52:00.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,即让你同情杀害你所爱所关心的角色的人
Dialogue: 1,4:52:00.00,4:52:03.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,让你看到故事的另一面
Dialogue: 1,4:52:03.58,4:52:05.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,看清不同的视角下的故事
Dialogue: 1,4:52:05.76,4:52:08.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,并明白有时暴力并不是答案
Dialogue: 1,4:52:08.92,4:52:14.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,而有时可怕的事情换个角度看就变得合理了
Dialogue: 1,4:52:14.38,4:52:18.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者当你被置于某种类似情境下的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:52:19.16,4:52:23.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,你甚至可以发现自己有时也变成了那个角色 做着那样的事请
Dialogue: 1,4:52:23.17,4:52:27.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,也因此我认为游戏的故事是有趣的
Dialogue: 1,4:52:27.76,4:52:29.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我认为故事内容也是恰当的
Dialogue: 1,4:52:29.29,4:52:31.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,而这就……每当我这样去思考这个游戏的时候
Dialogue: 1,4:52:31.84,4:52:36.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,我就发现这个游戏竟然给我留下如此深刻的印象 感觉它绝对是个神作
Dialogue: 1,4:52:37.42,4:52:40.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得我的纠结之处在于 这是一款《最后生还者》系列的游戏
Dialogue: 1,4:52:41.48,4:52:49.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们为了这个故事不但牺牲了乔尔 还牺牲了艾莉
Dialogue: 1,4:52:49.09,4:52:53.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我认为他们搬上来一个新的故事
Dialogue: 1,4:52:53.29,4:52:58.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,从头到尾讲一个新角色的故事并不会达到前作那样的高度
Dialogue: 1,4:52:58.24,4:53:05.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,这也是游戏的故事线——“原谅不可饶恕之事” 也是视频标题——的部分由来
Dialogue: 1,4:53:06.13,4:53:10.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这也是使它令人印象深刻的部分原因
Dialogue: 1,4:53:10.93,4:53:16.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为在玩游戏的时候 你面对的是你已经认识了近十年的人物
Dialogue: 1,4:53:16.35,4:53:18.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,到录制视频的时候是七年多
Dialogue: 1,4:53:18.58,4:53:21.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,等大家在看这个视频的时候肯定更久了
Dialogue: 1,4:53:22.45,4:53:26.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这才是真正令人郁闷的
Dialogue: 1,4:53:26.52,4:53:33.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我能理解大家 制作组为了讲这个故事而牺牲了两个你喜欢的角色
Dialogue: 1,4:53:33.34,4:53:36.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且他们在发售前就保证过
Dialogue: 1,4:53:36.16,4:53:40.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们正在做对这些角色最好的事情 他们不会抹黑这些角色
Dialogue: 1,4:53:40.84,4:53:44.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是对乔尔和艾莉最好的安排
Dialogue: 1,4:53:44.08,4:53:48.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,如果他们觉得这个故事不合适 他们就不会制作这个游戏
Dialogue: 1,4:53:49.72,4:53:53.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以我也能理解大家在这方面的沮丧
Dialogue: 1,4:53:53.80,4:53:57.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多人也感到沮丧的是游戏似乎没有一个圆满的结局
Dialogue: 1,4:53:57.46,4:54:00.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉失去了一切 然后继续前行下去
Dialogue: 1,4:54:01.24,4:54:03.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,她忘记了乔尔 忘记了蒂娜
Dialogue: 1,4:54:03.94,4:54:06.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,抛弃了一切
Dialogue: 1,4:54:06.20,4:54:10.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,也失去了一切
Dialogue: 1,4:54:10.08,4:54:17.14,辉中,,0,0,0,,把乔尔的东西留在农场的房子里 坦然面对乔尔的事情 继续向前看
Dialogue: 1,4:54:17.14,4:54:21.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,但实际上我觉得这里隐藏着一个好结局
Dialogue: 1,4:54:21.13,4:54:23.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,原因出自一个小细节
Dialogue: 1,4:54:23.02,4:54:35.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,小到有很多人在推特和Discord上告诉我之后 我才真正发觉
Dialogue: 1,4:54:35.02,4:54:38.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且当我真的深入研究以后 简直都惊呆了
Dialogue: 1,4:54:38.11,4:54:40.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这套解释非常有意思
Dialogue: 1,4:54:40.68,4:54:46.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,在TLOU2核心故事的结尾 也就是艾莉和埃比对打那段
Dialogue: 1,4:54:47.05,4:54:53.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉身上没有穿戴任何装饰品 她是赤手空拳被埃比拿下的
Dialogue: 1,4:54:53.26,4:54:58.36,辉中,,0,0,0,,但再看她在游戏结尾的农场里时
Dialogue: 1,4:54:58.36,4:55:01.75,辉中,,0,0,0,,她却戴着这样的一条手链
Dialogue: 1,4:55:01.75,4:55:05.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,有趣的是这条手链竟然还作为周边被收录在游戏的典藏版里
Dialogue: 1,4:55:05.62,4:55:10.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,但这其实是蒂娜的手链
Dialogue: 1,4:55:10.40,4:55:16.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,我刚说“竟然”是因为这只是一个很不起眼的小玩意 却被纳入典藏版里
Dialogue: 1,4:55:16.99,4:55:21.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们懂的 小饰品罢了 但还挺有意思的
Dialogue: 1,4:55:21.10,4:55:23.13,辉中,,0,0,0,,问题在于 艾莉戴着它
Dialogue: 1,4:55:23.46,4:55:29.53,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉还戴着它 即使艾莉看上去已经和蒂娜分道扬镳
Dialogue: 1,4:55:29.53,4:55:34.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,即使蒂娜已经远走他乡 和艾莉断了联系
Dialogue: 1,4:55:34.48,4:55:36.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以一种解释是
Dialogue: 1,4:55:36.76,4:55:41.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,两人在很久以后又回到了这个房子 或者至少艾莉回来了
Dialogue: 1,4:55:41.68,4:55:45.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,房子已经被被搬空了 而两人决定彻底搬离杰克逊小镇
Dialogue: 1,4:55:45.85,4:55:49.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,她们要搬走了 所以房子才看上去破烂不堪
Dialogue: 1,4:55:50.04,4:55:54.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,而艾莉决定把所有乔尔的东西留下 因为她决定要向前看
Dialogue: 1,4:55:54.82,4:55:57.49,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以她不想继续把这些东西留在身边
Dialogue: 1,4:55:57.49,4:56:02.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此 她戴着手链并不仅仅是意味着
Dialogue: 1,4:56:02.96,4:56:08.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,象征她仍然觉得与蒂娜有所羁绊
Dialogue: 1,4:56:08.17,4:56:12.04,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者她想念蒂娜 或者希望她反悔之类的
Dialogue: 1,4:56:12.04,4:56:18.99,辉中,,0,0,0,,而是在直接向玩家传达一个消息 即两人已经重新在一起了
Dialogue: 1,4:56:19.38,4:56:21.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,而她们决定一起继续抛弃过去 向前看
Dialogue: 1,4:56:21.76,4:56:26.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,蒂娜已经原谅了艾莉 而且之后两人也幸福地生活在一起了
Dialogue: 1,4:56:27.79,4:56:30.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,好吧 听着有点……可能有点离谱
Dialogue: 1,4:56:30.32,4:56:35.29,辉中,,0,0,0,,TLOU的世界观里可没什么好结局的故事
Dialogue: 1,4:56:35.29,4:56:40.63,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是认为游戏结束时的感情基调应该是令人振奋 阳光向上的
Dialogue: 1,4:56:40.63,4:56:46.15,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且游戏结束后回到标题画面 度假村也变成了阳光明媚的海滩
Dialogue: 1,4:56:46.15,4:56:48.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏到达了它的高潮
Dialogue: 1,4:56:48.64,4:56:50.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得也是在暗示同样的事情
Dialogue: 1,4:56:50.92,4:56:54.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,这是一个阳光 美满的结局 天已经亮了
Dialogue: 1,4:56:54.94,4:56:59.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,黑暗之后总有光明 黑夜之后太阳总会升起
Dialogue: 1,4:56:59.92,4:57:03.00,辉中,,0,0,0,,随便你想怎么比喻……
Dialogue: 1,4:57:03.24,4:57:04.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,所以
Dialogue: 1,4:57:04.96,4:57:08.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我选择相信游戏结尾其实是个好结局
Dialogue: 1,4:57:08.02,4:57:12.61,辉中,,0,0,0,,艾莉、蒂娜和小宝宝最后幸福地在一起
Dialogue: 1,4:57:12.61,4:57:15.70,辉中,,0,0,0,,隐居在某个小木屋里
Dialogue: 1,4:57:15.70,4:57:18.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,离开杰克逊小镇 继续生活
Dialogue: 1,4:57:18.44,4:57:21.32,辉中,,0,0,0,,不再为这一切所困扰 拖累
Dialogue: 1,4:57:22.48,4:57:24.40,辉中,,0,0,0,,至少我选择相信这样的解释
Dialogue: 1,4:57:24.40,4:57:29.65,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我认为艾莉在经历这些后 值得有这样的生活
Dialogue: 1,4:57:29.65,4:57:32.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此我在了解到这样不同的解释后选择了相信
Dialogue: 1,4:57:32.92,4:57:40.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我觉得在最后的农场场景中给艾莉的手链一个镜头
Dialogue: 1,4:57:40.62,4:57:45.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,也是在明摆着想告诉大家发生了什么
Dialogue: 1,4:57:45.67,4:57:50.92,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这可能是一个小小的暗示 想告诉大家其实结局还是美好的
Dialogue: 1,4:57:50.92,4:57:53.86,辉中,,0,0,0,,但谁知道呢？我倾向于好结局
Dialogue: 1,4:57:55.66,4:57:58.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,但总的来说 这个游戏是非常……
Dialogue: 1,4:57:59.26,4:58:02.31,辉中,,0,0,0,,让人难顶的
Dialogue: 1,4:58:02.31,4:58:08.68,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为游戏内容完全不是玩家所期待甚至所希望的
Dialogue: 1,4:58:08.68,4:58:13.54,辉中,,0,0,0,,但即便如此 我认为他们也完成了我在视频之前所说的目标
Dialogue: 1,4:58:13.54,4:58:17.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,即让玩家慢慢学会站在埃比这边
Dialogue: 1,4:58:17.62,4:58:24.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,通过翻转剧本 让玩家能从原来憎恨埃比变成后来开始关心她
Dialogue: 1,4:58:24.55,4:58:28.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,于是当你等到你曾咬牙切齿期盼的那个时刻
Dialogue: 1,4:58:28.95,4:58:35.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,当你可以操控艾莉杀死埃比的时候 你的感受只剩空虚与失落
Dialogue: 1,4:58:35.47,4:58:40.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为你意识到这已经不是简单的复仇的问题了
Dialogue: 1,4:58:40.06,4:58:47.95,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这样一个叙事上的安排决策真的很了不起
Dialogue: 1,4:58:47.95,4:58:58.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,真的 无论你喜欢与否 都应该为顽皮狗这如此大胆、风险极高决策点赞
Dialogue: 1,4:58:58.62,4:59:04.06,辉中,,0,0,0,,风险高到会让无数粉丝出现两极分化的局面 会激怒无数人
Dialogue: 1,4:59:04.06,4:59:08.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,我都能想象到游戏发售时他们收到了多少刀片
Dialogue: 1,4:59:08.59,4:59:11.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们其实都知道 他们其实早有准备
Dialogue: 1,4:59:12.10,4:59:17.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,但他们还是选择去做这样的事
Dialogue: 1,4:59:17.44,4:59:22.19,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们本可以制作一部内容烂大街的续作
Dialogue: 1,4:59:22.19,4:59:25.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,让乔尔和艾莉踏上一段新的旅程
Dialogue: 1,4:59:25.02,4:59:29.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,或许安排让埃比杀死汤米 然后埃比被一路追杀
Dialogue: 1,4:59:29.44,4:59:33.52,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后在结尾之前 埃比杀死了乔尔
Dialogue: 1,4:59:33.52,4:59:37.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后艾莉找埃比复仇 血债血偿
Dialogue: 1,4:59:37.03,4:59:41.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像《神秘海域》系列那样 最终一切都得到了清算
Dialogue: 1,4:59:41.26,4:59:42.76,辉中,,0,0,0,,但某个角色领便当了
Dialogue: 1,4:59:42.76,4:59:45.43,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后游戏让你更加珍惜现在所拥有的的一切
Dialogue: 1,4:59:45.43,4:59:47.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,顽皮狗完全可以做一个这样的剧情
Dialogue: 1,4:59:47.38,4:59:49.39,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们完全可以走这条轻松的路
Dialogue: 1,4:59:49.39,4:59:52.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得那样评价会更高 游戏体验也会更扎实
Dialogue: 1,4:59:52.93,4:59:57.62,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得这并不会让更多的人去思考
Dialogue: 1,4:59:57.62,4:59:59.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,游戏中剧情的另一种叙述方式
Dialogue: 1,4:59:59.93,5:00:03.57,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为我曾经在这方面讲过很多年了
Dialogue: 1,5:00:03.57,5:00:06.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,很多年大概指两到三年
Dialogue: 1,5:00:07.45,5:00:11.44,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为游戏是叙述故事的一种进化
Dialogue: 1,5:00:11.44,5:00:17.38,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为游戏是讲故事的一个非凡的工具
Dialogue: 1,5:00:18.79,5:00:21.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,我不禁觉得TLOU2这款游戏
Dialogue: 1,5:00:21.94,5:00:28.78,辉中,,0,0,0,,让在游戏这个平台上讲故事的方式上有了巨大的飞跃
Dialogue: 1,5:00:28.78,5:00:31.12,辉中,,0,0,0,,尤其在迈向次时代的时期
Dialogue: 1,5:00:31.42,5:00:33.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,有些人可能会想那这也太惨了
Dialogue: 1,5:00:33.01,5:00:37.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,有些人听了会问 难道以后的故事都不能有一个幸福美满的结局了吗？
Dialogue: 1,5:00:37.24,5:00:40.81,辉中,,0,0,0,,以后所有游戏都要变得如此黑暗 如此沉闷 如此令人悲伤吗？
Dialogue: 1,5:00:40.81,5:00:44.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,然而对于某些故事来说的确就是这样
Dialogue: 1,5:00:44.05,5:00:45.16,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我认为更多的是
Dialogue: 1,5:00:45.16,5:00:51.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,应该尽量把叙事推到能发人深省的高度
Dialogue: 1,5:00:51.05,5:00:55.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,只是很少有结局美满的故事能做到
Dialogue: 1,5:00:55.21,5:00:56.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,我很喜欢神秘海域系列
Dialogue: 1,5:00:56.59,5:01:00.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,我给神海全系列都做过评测
Dialogue: 1,5:01:00.94,5:01:04.21,辉中,,0,0,0,,TLOU2发售之前我就在做这件事
Dialogue: 1,5:01:04.21,5:01:07.48,辉中,,0,0,0,,然后就又是一期期这样长的视频
Dialogue: 1,5:01:09.49,5:01:12.85,辉中,,0,0,0,,但那些游戏故事并没有引人深思
Dialogue: 1,5:01:12.85,5:01:16.72,辉中,,0,0,0,,我玩神秘海域通关后 自己从来没有呆在那就……
Dialogue: 1,5:01:18.43,5:01:21.64,辉中,,0,0,0,,“哇……刚刚那段是什么意思？我该怎么理解？”
Dialogue: 1,5:01:21.64,5:01:26.09,辉中,,0,0,0,,我想不通 我脑中有太多矛盾在里面 想法情绪乱成一锅粥
Dialogue: 1,5:01:26.09,5:01:32.83,辉中,,0,0,0,,神海系列的情感部分主要是刺激的动作戏
Dialogue: 1,5:01:32.83,5:01:40.18,辉中,,0,0,0,,偶尔会穿插一些你喜欢的两个角色之间轻佻戏谑的暖心时刻
Dialogue: 1,5:01:40.18,5:01:41.11,辉中,,0,0,0,,它就是这样的游戏
Dialogue: 1,5:01:43.30,5:01:49.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为顽皮狗为了讲述一个更有意义的故事而在不断试探极限
Dialogue: 1,5:01:49.60,5:01:51.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我觉得他们很成功
Dialogue: 1,5:01:51.46,5:01:56.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为他们取得的成就相当了不起
Dialogue: 1,5:01:56.02,5:02:00.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此尽管我对TLOU2的游戏节奏方面有所质疑
Dialogue: 1,5:02:00.35,5:02:06.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,因为游戏在两个角色的内容之间切换会让玩家失去游玩重心
Dialogue: 1,5:02:06.01,5:02:09.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我仍然认为这是一款非凡的游戏
Dialogue: 1,5:02:09.94,5:02:13.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为这款游戏瑕不掩瑜
Dialogue: 1,5:02:13.60,5:02:16.42,辉中,,0,0,0,,偶尔一些内容的处理可能显得平淡无奇
Dialogue: 1,5:02:16.42,5:02:19.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,导致有些角色在我看来没有给玩家带来应有的触动
Dialogue: 1,5:02:19.87,5:02:22.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,比如欧文和梅尔
Dialogue: 1,5:02:22.69,5:02:26.08,辉中,,0,0,0,,他们遇害时 我能看出游戏希望我们能感受悲伤与自责
Dialogue: 1,5:02:26.08,5:02:31.45,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我直到玩过埃比的部分后才切身感受到这一点
Dialogue: 1,5:02:31.45,5:02:34.33,辉中,,0,0,0,,我是在看到埃比的反应后才感觉悲伤与自责
Dialogue: 1,5:02:34.33,5:02:38.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,并不是看到欧文和梅尔遇害才这样
Dialogue: 1,5:02:38.47,5:02:42.91,辉中,,0,0,0,,我个人觉得顽皮狗在这块内容上是一个败笔
Dialogue: 1,5:02:42.91,5:02:44.74,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我觉得他们不是有意的
Dialogue: 1,5:02:45.88,5:02:47.50,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像我之前提到的那样
Dialogue: 1,5:02:47.50,5:02:49.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,但……总的来说
Dialogue: 1,5:02:49.60,5:02:51.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得游戏仍然是很震撼的
Dialogue: 1,5:02:51.91,5:02:57.25,辉中,,0,0,0,,得出这个结论就花了我几个月、几周目的游玩时间
Dialogue: 1,5:02:57.25,5:03:01.96,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且我跟大家说实话 我第一次通关以后完全不是……
Dialogue: 1,5:03:03.46,5:03:06.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,完全不是像我现在这样
Dialogue: 1,5:03:06.10,5:03:10.03,辉中,,0,0,0,,我当时绝对不会说这是一个神作
Dialogue: 1,5:03:10.03,5:03:14.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,我绝对不会说这个游戏很震撼或者多么了不起
Dialogue: 1,5:03:14.05,5:03:18.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,我当时非常沮丧 思绪也很乱
Dialogue: 1,5:03:18.79,5:03:24.58,辉中,,0,0,0,,但通关了几次之后 就像品味慢慢变了一样
Dialogue: 1,5:03:24.58,5:03:27.79,辉中,,0,0,0,,就像一款陈年老酒
Dialogue: 1,5:03:27.79,5:03:30.67,辉中,,0,0,0,,这个游戏是那种……你越是投入进去
Dialogue: 1,5:03:30.67,5:03:34.66,辉中,,0,0,0,,就越能感受并欣赏到它所有小细节、所有情节和人物特点的游戏
Dialogue: 1,5:03:34.66,5:03:39.46,辉中,,0,0,0,,就越能感受并欣赏到它所有小细节、所有情节和人物特点的游戏
Dialogue: 1,5:03:39.46,5:03:44.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此我觉得TLOU2这个游戏仍然是非凡的
Dialogue: 1,5:03:44.02,5:03:46.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,它会是我心中的年度游戏吗？……不好说
Dialogue: 1,5:03:46.80,5:03:51.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真心希望赛博朋克2077出来以后能震惊四座
Dialogue: 1,5:03:51.37,5:03:53.41,辉中,,0,0,0,,我真的很喜欢CDPR
Dialogue: 1,5:03:53.41,5:03:57.82,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且从我看到的他们去年（2019年）E3上的闭门演示中来看
Dialogue: 1,5:03:57.82,5:04:01.93,辉中,,0,0,0,,我觉得这个游戏有火的潜力
Dialogue: 1,5:04:01.93,5:04:05.35,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我还是担心它会被宣发抬得太高
Dialogue: 1,5:04:05.35,5:04:07.69,辉中,,0,0,0,,很可能会在这方面翻车
Dialogue: 1,5:04:07.69,5:04:09.01,辉中,,0,0,0,,到时候再看吧 谁知道呢
Dialogue: 1,5:04:09.01,5:04:13.60,辉中,,0,0,0,,等大家看到这个视频的时候可能已经通关2077了
Dialogue: 1,5:04:13.60,5:04:17.02,辉中,,0,0,0,,而且可能通关了之后看这视频然后笑话我被打脸了
Dialogue: 1,5:04:17.02,5:04:19.87,辉中,,0,0,0,,或者这样那样……太可怕了 我什么都不知道！
Dialogue: 1,5:04:19.87,5:04:21.37,辉中,,0,0,0,,我可什么都不知道！
Dialogue: 1,5:04:21.37,5:04:27.94,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我可以肯定的是 TLOU系列为整个游戏行业的进步做了很多贡献
Dialogue: 1,5:04:27.94,5:04:33.10,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为他们所承担的风险真的是
Dialogue: 1,5:04:36.07,5:04:38.59,辉中,,0,0,0,,“值得鼓掌的” 如果有这样的词的话
Dialogue: 1,5:04:38.59,5:04:42.34,辉中,,0,0,0,,我很欣赏他们敢于冒险的勇气
Dialogue: 1,5:04:42.34,5:04:47.20,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然我觉得可能很多人都希望他们去走另一条更好走的路
Dialogue: 1,5:04:47.20,5:04:51.55,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我真的尊敬他们所作的一切 而且做的很棒
Dialogue: 1,5:04:52.39,5:04:56.47,辉中,,0,0,0,,虽然换做是我我肯定不会这样做
Dialogue: 1,5:04:56.47,5:04:59.56,辉中,,0,0,0,,但我很高兴他们做了
Dialogue: 1,5:05:00.97,5:05:04.05,辉中,,0,0,0,,但即使是现在 我也……非常矛盾
Dialogue: 1,5:05:04.28,5:05:08.84,辉中,,0,0,0,,我认为艺术的重点是激发人们的思考
Dialogue: 1,5:05:08.84,5:05:15.24,辉中,,0,0,0,,在故事中发生的一切都在让你思考你在这个世界上的位置和正在发生的一切
Dialogue: 1,5:05:15.24,5:05:17.26,辉中,,0,0,0,,在故事中发生的一切都在让你思考你在这个世界上的位置和正在发生的一切
Dialogue: 1,5:05:17.26,5:05:23.17,辉中,,0,0,0,,而我认为TLOU2做到了其他游戏都没有做到的这一点
Dialogue: 1,5:05:23.17,5:05:26.80,辉中,,0,0,0,,因此我真的想说 谢谢你 顽皮狗
Dialogue: 1,5:05:26.80,5:05:31.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,你们做的真的很棒 真的

Dialogue: 1,5:06:08.05,5:06:10.27,辉中,,0,0,0,,花了我相当相当多的时间

Dialogue: 2,0:01:12.09,0:01:17.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,So {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} opens with Joel, discussing the ending events of the first game.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:17.58,0:01:20.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,The cameras focused on the thread board of the guitar,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:20.34,0:01:23.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,which has a very distinctive symbol on it, which will be important later.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:23.91,0:01:27.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want you to take a mental picture of this scene
Dialogue: 2,0:01:27.25,0:01:30.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's going to come back all the way at the end of the game.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:30.60,0:01:33.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,During this conversation between Joel and Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:33.81,0:01:38.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel explains his decision to save Ellie over humanity.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:38.37,0:01:43.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now even this point was one of controversy when the game first launched.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:43.86,0:01:45.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:45.42,0:01:50.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,there was a serious question as to whether or not the Fireflies would be able to develop a vaccine at all.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:50.91,0:01:55.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was one of the reasons that a lot of people thought that Joel's actions were highly justified.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:55.32,0:01:58.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not just in that he was saving Ellie, his "daughter character",
Dialogue: 2,0:01:58.89,0:02:02.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,but rather that he didn't want to sacrifice Ellie's life
Dialogue: 2,0:02:02.78,0:02:07.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the sake of a cause which likely wouldn't find success any ways.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:07.14,0:02:11.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, the Fireflies in the first game are pretty damn incompetent.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:11.52,0:02:14.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,They hire somebody from outside their ranks to transport,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:14.67,0:02:19.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,who is likely the most important human being who has ever lived in the form of Ellie
Dialogue: 2,0:02:19.29,0:02:24.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the way across the country in order to hopefully develop a vaccine.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:24.21,0:02:28.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when you get there and you explore the hospital at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:28.38,0:02:31.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,you find out that a lot of the doctors involved in this procedure
Dialogue: 2,0:02:31.76,0:02:34.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,are unsure as to whether or not it's even possible.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:34.68,0:02:39.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, literally, every single person in this hospital
Dialogue: 2,0:02:39.35,0:02:46.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,is completely inexperienced in developing a vaccine for a fungus such as this.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:46.29,0:02:49.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the Fireflies argument is that at least there's a chance.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:49.73,0:02:50.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,If Ellie runs off,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:50.88,0:02:54.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they don't even attempt to extract any of the antibodies
Dialogue: 2,0:02:54.01,0:02:59.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,or whatever the hell his inside of her brain that allows her to survive after having a bite.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:59.25,0:03:02.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then they will never know whether or not a vaccine is possible.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:02.88,0:03:07.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if they crack her skull open and try and develop some sort of vaccine at the very least,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:07.62,0:03:09.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,then there's a chance.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.15,0:03:11.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, in the opening for this sequel,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:11.97,0:03:14.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,we see that Joel is pretty confident
Dialogue: 2,0:03:14.39,0:03:18.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they were trying to develop a vaccine and that they likely would have been able to,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:18.60,0:03:19.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that it would have killed her.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.95,0:03:24.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's Tommy's expression that I think sets the tone
Dialogue: 2,0:03:24.44,0:03:27.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,for how the player is supposed to feel about Joel's decision.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:27.87,0:03:33.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,He's stunned, but at the same time he can't really blame Joel for the choice that he made.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:33.45,0:03:36.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, later on, in this very intro sequence,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:36.96,0:03:40.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy turns to Joel and tells him that he would have done the same thing.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:40.56,0:03:46.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, the choice to open the game in this way is very, very important.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.14,0:03:50.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,The writers over at Naughty Dog wanted to remind the player of what Joel had done
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.55,0:03:56.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and establish that as the fulcrum from which every narrative mechanism will hinge.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:57.04,0:04:01.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,After this conversation, Tommy still unsure of how to react,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:01.26,0:04:05.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,simply tells Joel to hop on his horse and head back into town.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:05.31,0:04:08.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,It buys Tommy some time in order to form an opinion,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:08.40,0:04:12.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it also gives the player a chance to settle back into this world.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:12.93,0:04:15.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really common for sequels to rush into things,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:15.54,0:04:19.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,giving the player a chance to see something new and fresh and different
Dialogue: 2,0:04:19.05,0:04:21.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they only could have dreamed of in the first game.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:21.87,0:04:25.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, and thankfully Naughty Dog doesn't do this.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:25.35,0:04:28.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,They take their time during this intro to set things up,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:28.29,0:04:30.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I think it works very, very well.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:30.66,0:04:33.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,You ride through a beautiful landscape and come up on Jackson,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:33.87,0:04:38.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's at this time that we get our first look at a fully realized Jackson,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.37,0:04:41.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,the city that we saw peak of at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 2,0:04:41.31,0:04:42.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that we could only imagine.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:42.86,0:04:44.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I've got to hand it to Naughty Dog.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:44.67,0:04:51.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,This opening sequence has one of the most well realized cities I've ever seen in any video game ever.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:51.57,0:04:53.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,It truly is fantastic.
Dialogue: 2,0:04:53.52,0:05:01.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,Every NPC, every animation, every building, every step in the snow is detailed and realistic.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:01.62,0:05:03.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,As far as immersion is concerned,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:03.48,0:05:08.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think this is one of the most fantastically effective games that's ever been created.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:08.60,0:05:10.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,After you reach the inside of the city,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:10.53,0:05:16.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy and Joel hop off of their horses and Tommy offers to stow Joel's horse for him,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:16.26,0:05:19.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,while also saying that he'll take the truth to his grave.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:19.35,0:05:21.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,This implies a couple of things.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:21.06,0:05:24.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,For one, it might seem as though he's referring directly to Ellie
Dialogue: 2,0:05:24.20,0:05:28.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,that if Ellie were to find out this truth, it would cause a lot of problems.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:28.74,0:05:31.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, as far as Ellie is concerned,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:31.08,0:05:35.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel simply took Ellie after a bunch of tests were run,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:35.40,0:05:40.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it was clear that she was not going to be able to provide any sort of help towards a vaccine at all.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:40.77,0:05:42.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:42.03,0:05:45.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's pretty clear that Ellie sees through this lie that Joel is telling,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:45.54,0:05:48.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, she expects that there's more to this story.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:48.84,0:05:52.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the sake of their relationship, she simply goes along with it.
Dialogue: 2,0:05:52.14,0:05:54.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I think there's another implication to this as well,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:54.78,0:05:59.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that is that if other people in the camp were to find out what Joel had done,
Dialogue: 2,0:05:59.19,0:06:01.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,I am not so sure that they would approve of it either.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:01.62,0:06:06.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, we can talk all day about how incompetent the Fireflies were in the first game.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:06.21,0:06:08.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think there's a real argument to be had there.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:08.31,0:06:11.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, if I had to entrust them with the fate of humanity,
Dialogue: 2,0:06:11.46,0:06:14.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would hop on the next asteroid off the planet.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:14.28,0:06:18.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I mean, though, is that Naughty Dog is trying to tell his story,
Dialogue: 2,0:06:18.24,0:06:22.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they're framing the plot points the way that they want you the player to see them.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:22.47,0:06:24.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the sake of this story,
Dialogue: 2,0:06:24.15,0:06:28.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's important to understand that the Fireflies were the ones that were trying to save humanity
Dialogue: 2,0:06:28.84,0:06:36.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,and were apparently on the cusp of developing a vaccine to save countless millions of lives.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:36.06,0:06:40.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,And once again, for the sake of this story, that's been told in {\i1}TLOU2{\i0},
Dialogue: 2,0:06:40.84,0:06:43.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel is the one that undid that.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:43.52,0:06:49.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, at the very least, if Ellie had gone under the knife, there would have been a chance for a vaccine.
Dialogue: 2,0:06:49.68,0:06:55.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,By killing the doctors that were about to operate on Ellie and potentially develop a vaccine,
Dialogue: 2,0:06:55.71,0:06:58.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,he effectively saved his "daughter figure",
Dialogue: 2,0:06:58.23,0:07:02.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,but he damned all of humanity for the rest of time.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:02.67,0:07:06.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,In other words, he strained at a gnat but swallowed a camel.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:06.39,0:07:11.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,He traded what seemed to be a smaller evil for a much much larger evil,
Dialogue: 2,0:07:11.31,0:07:17.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he did this because his judgment was clouded by his own personal wants and wishes.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:17.10,0:07:23.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,This isn't to say that Joel would or does regret any of this in this particular sequence.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:23.13,0:07:26.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it is to say that the players should start seriously considering
Dialogue: 2,0:07:26.44,0:07:32.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether or not Joel's actions were justified, or perhaps even whether or not they were right.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:32.31,0:07:32.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry,
Dialogue: 2,0:07:32.99,0:07:38.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,Naughty Dog is going to help you think about this by constantly bringing it up using flashbacks
Dialogue: 2,0:07:38.39,0:07:41.25,辉英,,0,0,0,, as Ellie grew up in Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:41.25,0:07:43.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I promise you before you know it,
Dialogue: 2,0:07:43.05,0:07:46.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,you might even be convinced that Joel is in fact a villain.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:46.74,0:07:52.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,This isn't to say that Joel is unlikable character that you should hate him or wish that he were dead,
Dialogue: 2,0:07:52.65,0:07:56.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,but rather Joel is the one that damned humanity.
Dialogue: 2,0:07:56.76,0:08:03.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you tell any other story and there's a character which damns humanity for the sake of one single person,
Dialogue: 2,0:08:03.90,0:08:06.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,we would say he's a bad guy.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:06.00,0:08:08.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or perhaps we wouldn't even say bad guy,
Dialogue: 2,0:08:08.64,0:08:13.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,we would simply say that he was a confused or perhaps mistaken individual,
Dialogue: 2,0:08:13.56,0:08:15.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,whose motivations were complex.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:15.90,0:08:20.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the point is, it's not as simple as hero and villain.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:20.94,0:08:23.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a lot of gray in between.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:23.19,0:08:28.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this intro sequence is just shortly after Joel's arrival, while Ellie is still young.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:28.83,0:08:34.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's living out of grandmother's suite in the back of the house that is presumably owned by Joel.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:34.53,0:08:36.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's super cute that she has her own space,
Dialogue: 2,0:08:36.60,0:08:41.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it even now shows and tells a lot about their relationship.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:41.90,0:08:46.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now granted, Joel is a middle aged man that found this little girl,
Dialogue: 2,0:08:46.62,0:08:49.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he took her halfway across the country,
Dialogue: 2,0:08:49.32,0:08:51.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,rescued her from a bunch of cannibals,
Dialogue: 2,0:08:51.57,0:08:56.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,and now has her in a town that his brother runs with his wife.
Dialogue: 2,0:08:56.67,0:09:01.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,It could be presumed that her staying in his house could be considered an appropriate.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:01.71,0:09:03.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I don't think that's the point here.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:03.78,0:09:08.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel is Ellie's "father figure", and I don't think that's a controversial thing to say.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:08.58,0:09:15.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,The fact that Ellie wants space, physical space separated from him means a lot.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:15.75,0:09:18.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, we see Ellie and she's drawing something
Dialogue: 2,0:09:18.59,0:09:21.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,that will come back time and time again throughout the rest of the game.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:21.27,0:09:25.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's actually pretty artsy and gifted, artistically,
Dialogue: 2,0:09:25.05,0:09:29.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,you'll see this in the note book that you'll be using throughout the course of the main game.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:29.34,0:09:33.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,She often draws pictures of what she sees or sketches out different things
Dialogue: 2,0:09:33.67,0:09:36.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,in order to remind her to return to that area
Dialogue: 2,0:09:36.52,0:09:41.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,or simply to keep a journal of the events and happenings of the main story.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:41.40,0:09:44.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's listening to music when Joel comes in.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:44.01,0:09:48.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a really cute and awkward moment, but it's pretty damn sweet.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:48.99,0:09:52.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,It doesn't take a body language expert to see that there's a lot of tension here.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:52.83,0:09:57.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel's unsure of how to stand, where to move, how to talk, how to relate to her,
Dialogue: 2,0:09:57.15,0:09:59.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Ellie picks up on this as well.
Dialogue: 2,0:09:59.64,0:10:01.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,The tension is really palpable.
Dialogue: 2,0:10:01.71,0:10:05.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,They both know what happened in Utah hasn't been resolved,
Dialogue: 2,0:10:05.94,0:10:08.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,but neither knows how to broach the topic,
Dialogue: 2,0:10:08.16,0:10:10.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they simply delay it and push it off.
Dialogue: 2,0:10:10.56,0:10:16.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the point of this sequence is where Joel to express how much he needs Ellie in his life.

Dialogue: 2,0:14:00.78,0:14:04.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,But Naughty Dog doesn't show it to the player, at least not right now.
Dialogue: 2,0:14:04.41,0:14:08.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead, they rely on the dialog to explain what happened,
Dialogue: 2,0:14:08.28,0:14:09.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I can't help to notice that
Dialogue: 2,0:14:09.48,0:14:15.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the first instance where trailers are important to a contextual grasp of the game itself.

Dialogue: 2,0:14:24.79,0:14:32.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,Time and time again, stuff that was shown in the trailers is either changed drastically or is moved around

Dialogue: 2,0:14:37.99,0:14:42.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I understand that it's a small thing to point out or be frustrated by,
Dialogue: 2,0:14:42.07,0:14:46.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,because after all chances are every single person who bought the game had seen that trailer.
Dialogue: 2,0:14:46.80,0:14:51.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I still think it's strange to show a scene in a trailer,
Dialogue: 2,0:14:51.06,0:14:54.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,but then not show it in the game when that item is being discussed.
Dialogue: 2,0:14:54.87,0:14:57.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's one of countless times in this game,
Dialogue: 2,0:14:57.12,0:15:01.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Naughty Dog will take a sequence, cut it up into fifteen different parts
Dialogue: 2,0:15:01.22,0:15:05.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then spread it randomly, seemingly throughout the course of the story.
Dialogue: 2,0:15:05.04,0:15:07.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sometimes I think it helps with pacing
Dialogue: 2,0:15:07.04,0:15:11.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,by giving the player a break from a very stressful environment or activity,
Dialogue: 2,0:15:11.52,0:15:15.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,but often it feels as though it's jarring and out of nowhere.
Dialogue: 2,0:15:15.75,0:15:21.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, we're going to get to some very egregious examples of this later on in the story.

Dialogue: 2,0:15:32.73,0:15:35.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,and everybody wants you to know that it's bigoted.
Dialogue: 2,0:15:35.61,0:15:40.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,You get some sandwiches and then you go off to start on patrol.
Dialogue: 2,0:15:40.11,0:15:43.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's also important to understand that Jesse just broke up with Dina

Dialogue: 2,0:15:48.32,0:15:52.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or maybe Dina broke up with him, or maybe it was mutual.

Dialogue: 2,0:16:06.52,0:16:09.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I kind of found this snowball fight to be a little weird
Dialogue: 2,0:16:09.47,0:16:14.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it seemed as though it's meant to serve as some sort of combat introduction.
Dialogue: 2,0:16:14.37,0:16:19.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I think I was just reading too much into it because I don't think it does a very good job of that.

Dialogue: 2,0:16:22.17,0:16:27.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,as I stated previously on "New Game +" and on the hardest difficulty.
Dialogue: 2,0:16:27.39,0:16:32.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,After becoming completely familiarized with the controls after playing the entire game,
Dialogue: 2,0:16:32.07,0:16:37.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,this whole snowball fight was much more intriguing and interesting and frankly fun
Dialogue: 2,0:16:37.15,0:16:39.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,than it was the first time I played.
Dialogue: 2,0:16:39.12,0:16:43.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,The three tiered stance that Ellie's able to have between standing, crouch and prone
Dialogue: 2,0:16:43.90,0:16:46.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,is something that takes a minute to get used to.
Dialogue: 2,0:16:46.47,0:16:51.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know it sounds weird because that's true of pretty much any third person or first person shooter

Dialogue: 2,0:16:53.85,0:16:59.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in {\i1}TLOU2{\i0}, there are multiple levels of movement associated with each.

Dialogue: 2,0:17:00.48,0:17:05.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,The sequence does a very poor job of introducing the player to those three stances.
Dialogue: 2,0:17:05.58,0:17:10.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you are able to use each of those three stances in this sequence.
Dialogue: 2,0:17:10.32,0:17:11.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,It just seems a little jarring,
Dialogue: 2,0:17:11.79,0:17:15.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I will admit I appreciate the effort that they put into this
Dialogue: 2,0:17:15.56,0:17:18.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's still way better than the alternative,
Dialogue: 2,0:17:18.45,0:17:22.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,which would be to have the standard stereotypical sequence
Dialogue: 2,0:17:22.68,0:17:26.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the protagonist goes and has shown how to use a gun,
Dialogue: 2,0:17:26.58,0:17:31.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's like issue bottles or some craps…  I hate that.
Dialogue: 2,0:17:31.35,0:17:36.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Probably the most egregious example would be the opening of Fallout 3 when you're given a BB gun,
Dialogue: 2,0:17:36.57,0:17:41.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then you go downstairs, shoot some targets and then some giant radroaches.

Dialogue: 2,0:18:36.75,0:18:42.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,But all of those spoilers said that you were going to get to play half of the game as Abby

Dialogue: 2,0:18:44.34,0:18:48.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,I did not expect to be playing as her within the first 30 to 45 minutes.

Dialogue: 2,0:18:55.25,0:19:00.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they were going to flip out if you didn't play the whole game as Ellie and or Joel.
Dialogue: 2,0:19:00.12,0:19:03.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,But a key thing to understand here is that the player must give it time and effort

Dialogue: 2,0:19:26.91,0:19:31.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in my opinion, I don't think it's fair to say that playing as any character
Dialogue: 2,0:19:31.44,0:19:37.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,other than the one on the Box-Art is bad and means that the game is terrible and not worth your time.

Dialogue: 2,0:20:15.67,0:20:17.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this is a narrative game,
Dialogue: 2,0:20:17.55,0:20:21.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,it seems like it comes with the territory of this type of game to have dialogue
Dialogue: 2,0:20:21.54,0:20:23.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's much more realistic and grounded
Dialogue: 2,0:20:23.36,0:20:26.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,compared to dialogue that just hit you over the head with exposition.

Dialogue: 2,0:25:52.02,0:25:57.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,The fact that Joel is still going on patrols is, in my opinion, a bit of a stretch.
Dialogue: 2,0:25:57.48,0:25:59.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,It would be stupid for him to go on patrols,
Dialogue: 2,0:25:59.40,0:26:02.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially because he has a leadership position within the city.
Dialogue: 2,0:26:02.73,0:26:06.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,His super fancy house, I think, serves as proof positive of that,

Dialogue: 2,0:26:17.85,0:26:19.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to me, it just seems like a bit of a stretch
Dialogue: 2,0:26:19.76,0:26:23.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Tommy and Joel would be going out on patrols at all.
Dialogue: 2,0:26:23.22,0:26:28.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I understand that perhaps Joel or Tommy just want to get out and get their hands dirty.

Dialogue: 2,0:26:57.60,0:27:01.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the reason that I don't like narrative coincidences.

Dialogue: 2,0:27:50.76,0:27:53.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,The point is, go watch Breaking Bad, it's awesome.
Dialogue: 2,0:27:53.01,0:27:57.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other point is that narrative coincidences can be fine.

Dialogue: 2,0:31:20.34,0:31:24.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,But apparently this was a seriously considered intro sequence
Dialogue: 2,0:31:24.12,0:31:28.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of what we got in the end product of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0},
Dialogue: 2,0:31:28.02,0:31:35.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they decided to go in this current direction because the other version ran into a lot of pacing issues.
Dialogue: 2,0:31:35.25,0:31:37.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,In other words, you likely would have needed to spend
Dialogue: 2,0:31:37.75,0:31:42.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,the first five or six hours of the game in Jackson doing menial chores
Dialogue: 2,0:31:42.34,0:31:46.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,while getting to know Abby and her crew before being betrayed,
Dialogue: 2,0:31:46.35,0:31:50.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,it would have completely changed the structure of the rest of the game,
Dialogue: 2,0:31:50.25,0:31:53.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,so Naughty Dog just decided to expedite the process,
Dialogue: 2,0:31:53.49,0:31:59.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,have Abby get to Joel within the first two hours of the game and get the revenge plot moving.
Dialogue: 2,0:31:59.61,0:32:00.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that's fair.
Dialogue: 2,0:32:00.75,0:32:06.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just think it's a little sloppy, considering how many coincidences they rely on to make it happen.
Dialogue: 2,0:32:06.42,0:32:10.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,After Abby finds the tracks in the snow, leading to one of the patrols,
Dialogue: 2,0:32:10.26,0:32:13.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,we swap back to Ellie, whose on patrol with Dina.

Dialogue: 2,0:32:26.31,0:32:29.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,It really makes it look like every other development studio isn't even trying.

Dialogue: 2,0:32:33.75,0:32:35.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's some light flirting,
Dialogue: 2,0:32:35.36,0:32:38.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,clearly, Dina likes Ellie and Ellie likes Dina.
Dialogue: 2,0:32:38.82,0:32:41.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the tension starts to rise here.
Dialogue: 2,0:32:41.06,0:32:45.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again there's a lot of dread, things are going too well,
Dialogue: 2,0:32:45.45,0:32:51.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the world of {\i1}TLOU{\i0}, as we know, is very cutthroat, sometimes literally.
Dialogue: 2,0:32:51.19,0:32:56.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,The fact that everybody's happy that they are so carefree that they're even flirting with each other.
Dialogue: 2,0:32:56.58,0:33:01.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's unsettling, because we know that something bad has to happen soon.
Dialogue: 2,0:33:01.14,0:33:05.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you continue exploring, you go to an outpost to explore some abandoned houses.

Dialogue: 2,0:33:13.02,0:33:17.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,This will be VERY important at the end of the game,
Dialogue: 2,0:33:17.76,0:33:19.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,so make sure you remember this.

Dialogue: 2,0:33:26.07,0:33:27.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems like a small point,
Dialogue: 2,0:33:27.60,0:33:33.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially considering that Ellie and Joel have this deep connection with each other.
Dialogue: 2,0:33:33.09,0:33:37.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,She lives right behind him, even still in the grandmother's suite,
Dialogue: 2,0:33:37.20,0:33:40.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it makes sense that perhaps they would try to fill an empty time,

Dialogue: 2,0:33:42.60,0:33:46.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,But again, at the end of the game, we're going to find out a lot more.
Dialogue: 2,0:33:46.29,0:33:51.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this very statement by Ellie something that happens as an optional moment

Dialogue: 2,0:33:54.16,0:33:56.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is going to be very important.

Dialogue: 2,0:33:59.07,0:34:03.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,You cleared out, gives you the chance to explore some stealth options and combat,
Dialogue: 2,0:34:03.84,0:34:07.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's a good thing that this is a really well done portion of the game.
Dialogue: 2,0:34:07.44,0:34:10.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this stealth and the crafting that goes along with it
Dialogue: 2,0:34:10.76,0:34:13.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be the bread and butter of the game,
Dialogue: 2,0:34:13.71,0:34:16.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially if you're playing on higher difficulties,
Dialogue: 2,0:34:16.05,0:34:20.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to need to get acclimated to these mechanics as soon as possible.
Dialogue: 2,0:34:20.55,0:34:23.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are also given a quick introduction to Clickers as well,
Dialogue: 2,0:34:23.61,0:34:27.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,and these guys work almost identically to how they did in the first game.
Dialogue: 2,0:34:27.39,0:34:31.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't really feel the need to explain a lot as to how these sequences work,
Dialogue: 2,0:34:31.86,0:34:36.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,because if you've played the first game, you're going to know how this goes.
Dialogue: 2,0:34:36.00,0:34:39.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be a hot minute before we're thrown anything that's markedly different.
Dialogue: 2,0:34:39.57,0:34:41.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will say that in the first game,
Dialogue: 2,0:34:41.25,0:34:42.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,it always bugging me that
Dialogue: 2,0:34:42.20,0:34:45.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,Clickers are obviously able to navigate their environments
Dialogue: 2,0:34:45.91,0:34:51.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,by use of clicking sounds that use echolocation to map out their environment.
Dialogue: 2,0:34:51.27,0:34:55.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, they never were able to hear characters talking to each other
Dialogue: 2,0:34:55.40,0:34:59.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you reloading your weapon or moving your backpack on and off.
Dialogue: 2,0:34:59.88,0:35:06.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is mostly true again in this game, except only on the lower levels.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:06.36,0:35:11.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,In my testing, I actually found that on new game plus on Survivor difficulty,
Dialogue: 2,0:35:11.43,0:35:13.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Clickers can actually hear this as well.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:13.98,0:35:18.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you open your backpack to swap weapons, they'll notice and they'll come running.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:18.96,0:35:22.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was a game changer in terms of immersion.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:22.89,0:35:28.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Seriously, I've never played a game where I was so attentive to everything that I was doing,
Dialogue: 2,0:35:28.53,0:35:31.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,that I was scared to even open up the inventory,
Dialogue: 2,0:35:31.74,0:35:37.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,because I knew that it was going to create a small amount of sound that could attract Clickers,
Dialogue: 2,0:35:37.56,0:35:40.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,which could mean that I die and have to reload.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:40.36,0:35:43.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,Granted to some people, I'm sure that sounds absolutely terrible,
Dialogue: 2,0:35:43.44,0:35:46.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why there are difficulty settings to begin with.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:46.08,0:35:49.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you want to be totally immersed in this game,
Dialogue: 2,0:35:49.47,0:35:52.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,I recommend you play it on the hardest possible difficulty.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:52.92,0:35:54.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,It really does change everything.
Dialogue: 2,0:35:54.90,0:35:57.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another thing to note in this supermarket sequences that
Dialogue: 2,0:35:57.68,0:36:01.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie is wearing a mask when she encounters spores now.
Dialogue: 2,0:36:01.32,0:36:02.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you played the first game,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:02.43,0:36:07.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is going to be kind of weird because obviously Ellie is immune to the virus,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:07.41,0:36:10.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,or so we thought, why does she need to wear a mask?
Dialogue: 2,0:36:10.41,0:36:12.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the trailers we saw before the game's launch,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:12.66,0:36:16.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,a lot of people thought that this would mean that Ellie was no longer immune,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:16.11,0:36:20.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,or perhaps she was not as immune as she once was,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:20.49,0:36:24.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,so perhaps if she inhaled spores, that would make her very very sick,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:24.06,0:36:25.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,but she would eventually pull through it.
Dialogue: 2,0:36:25.74,0:36:28.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, the explanation is far simpler.
Dialogue: 2,0:36:28.02,0:36:33.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel and Ellie obviously know that Ellie is immune, but nobody else can know that.
Dialogue: 2,0:36:33.69,0:36:35.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,If people were to find out that Ellie's immune,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:35.82,0:36:39.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same crap with the Fireflies would happen all over again.
Dialogue: 2,0:36:39.72,0:36:43.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this seems to be much more Joel's wish than it is Ellie's,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:43.71,0:36:48.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,after all, Ellie was totally prepared and fine with giving her life
Dialogue: 2,0:36:48.37,0:36:51.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,to save humanity in the form of a vaccine,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:51.09,0:36:53.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this would of course make sense because Joel wanted to make sure
Dialogue: 2,0:36:53.84,0:36:58.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,nobody else would come to Ellie to try and capitalize on her gift,
Dialogue: 2,0:36:58.53,0:37:01.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,because if they did, it would mean that he would lose her.
Dialogue: 2,0:37:01.29,0:37:04.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the fact that Ellie is still using the mask, even though she doesn't need to,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:04.98,0:37:08.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think, serves as proof positive that she still cares about what he thinks,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:08.79,0:37:11.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she's yet to fully separate and become her own person.
Dialogue: 2,0:37:11.64,0:37:16.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this isn't something that's explained or really justified at this point in the game,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:16.14,0:37:22.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we will see an actual conversation between Ellie and Joel later on that explains all of this.
Dialogue: 2,0:37:22.32,0:37:24.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I throw a bunch of zombies and Clickers
Dialogue: 2,0:37:24.70,0:37:27.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,and eventually find your way up to the top of the supermarket,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:27.33,0:37:29.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you jumped down out to the front,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:29.58,0:37:35.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie and Dina's entire goal throughout exploring this supermarket was to clear it of infected,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:35.16,0:37:36.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they've done just that.
Dialogue: 2,0:37:36.33,0:37:40.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,Honestly, it's not a bad way of forcing the player to kill zombies
Dialogue: 2,0:37:40.12,0:37:44.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,in order to get experience with the combat system and become more comfortable with it.
Dialogue: 2,0:37:44.01,0:37:48.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,A lot of people are going to simply try to stealth around them in most instances,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:48.33,0:37:51.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially later in the game, when resources become very scarce.
Dialogue: 2,0:37:51.45,0:37:58.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,but if the characters mission is to wipe out all infected in an area to protect Jackson, the city,
Dialogue: 2,0:37:58.23,0:38:01.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,you all of a sudden don't have to worry about players doing that
Dialogue: 2,0:38:01.04,0:38:05.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they're going to be justified narratively in killing absolutely everything.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:05.46,0:38:07.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, they can't leave the area
Dialogue: 2,0:38:07.23,0:38:11.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,unless they've completely wiped all of the infected within that area.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:11.07,0:38:15.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once you get out of the supermarket, the blizzard starts to come in full force.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:15.93,0:38:21.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Ellie and Dina race through the snow, and end up at a library that Dina knew about.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:21.66,0:38:24.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the previous abode of somebody named Eugene,
Dialogue: 2,0:38:24.36,0:38:28.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,who, by my calculations, using the log book in the first outpost,
Dialogue: 2,0:38:28.50,0:38:34.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,likely died of a stroke laid in the previous year just a few months before this game starts.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:34.92,0:38:38.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, we know about him is that he was a firefly who served with Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,0:38:38.31,0:38:42.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he was also an electronics geek who was a total hippy.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:42.45,0:38:44.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,In other words, he loved weed.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:44.42,0:38:46.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,After being introduced to the workbench,
Dialogue: 2,0:38:46.32,0:38:52.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which has to be the most awesome and kick ass weapon customization system

Dialogue: 2,0:38:54.50,0:38:58.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,you went down to the basement where you find Eugene's true passion.
Dialogue: 2,0:38:58.68,0:39:00.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, when I first saw all of this,
Dialogue: 2,0:39:00.15,0:39:07.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,I had to ask the question: Was he actually like selling this stuff? Was he trading it?

Dialogue: 2,0:39:36.42,0:39:39.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it would be hilarious and kind of cool

Dialogue: 2,0:40:55.75,0:41:00.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,and having a very calm, comparatively conversation with Tess
Dialogue: 2,0:41:00.97,0:41:02.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,and prepare your butts
Dialogue: 2,0:41:02.00,0:41:06.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,because this is going to happen on a regular basis throughout all of the sequel.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:06.18,0:41:08.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,And thankfully, the predictability of this
Dialogue: 2,0:41:08.40,0:41:11.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,doesn't actually negatively affect the efficacy of this mechanism.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:11.52,0:41:12.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,It still works pretty well.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:12.70,0:41:18.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now as you run as Abby through all of these hordes, you eventually reach a chain link fence.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:18.28,0:41:21.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,You squeeze through it and a bunch of zombies grab onto you,
Dialogue: 2,0:41:21.81,0:41:28.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,start ripping your hat off and doing all sorts of gross stuff, and then one breaks through,
Dialogue: 2,0:41:28.23,0:41:29.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this happens.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:46.44,0:41:48.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now they haven't been introduced yet.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:48.00,0:41:51.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,but as of right now, Abby's just glad to be alive.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:51.54,0:41:52.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,As far as she knows,
Dialogue: 2,0:41:52.92,0:41:55.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel is just some random guy, as is Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,0:41:55.80,0:41:59.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they just happened to be in the right place at the right time to save her.
Dialogue: 2,0:41:59.71,0:42:01.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, a coincidence.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:01.32,0:42:04.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,This one's a little harder to justify and explained.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:04.75,0:42:08.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because they have no reason to be out at this dead end area
Dialogue: 2,0:42:08.34,0:42:10.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a building they have likely been in before.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:10.44,0:42:13.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,All of you escaped together to a ski lodge at the top of the mountain.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:13.68,0:42:14.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,You up on some horses,
Dialogue: 2,0:42:14.82,0:42:18.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,and after a brief introduction wherein Abby learns who she's with,
Dialogue: 2,0:42:18.96,0:42:21.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,she recommends that they weighed out the storm in a mansion
Dialogue: 2,0:42:21.50,0:42:23.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,that she and her friends have been staying in.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:23.55,0:42:26.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel and Tommy agree to go without any significant hesitance
Dialogue: 2,0:42:26.98,0:42:29.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,beyond the initial belief that they could survive in the lodge.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:30.05,0:42:32.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once again, it's another coincidence.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:32.55,0:42:34.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel and Tommy, aren't this naive,
Dialogue: 2,0:42:34.49,0:42:39.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,or at the very least they shouldn't be, even when pushed in these extreme conditions.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:39.27,0:42:42.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I mean is, I understand that there's a blizzard raging,
Dialogue: 2,0:42:42.27,0:42:47.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I understand that would push them into choices that they wouldn't otherwise make,
Dialogue: 2,0:42:47.49,0:42:49.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,should the weather be fine and dandy.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:49.35,0:42:53.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,But Joel and Tommy aren't stupid, and they know not to trust strangers,
Dialogue: 2,0:42:53.49,0:42:58.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,even a stranger that looks as innocent as a… hulked out heroin.
Dialogue: 2,0:42:58.44,0:43:03.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they definitely should know that they shouldn't trust a group of strangers
Dialogue: 2,0:43:03.51,0:43:06.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,that are living out of a mansion that's on their patrol route.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:06.93,0:43:09.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,She says they've been staying there for a few days
Dialogue: 2,0:43:09.20,0:43:14.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they have weapons, food and all sorts of things that could help Joel and Tommy.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:14.22,0:43:17.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,While it's nice that she's offering to help them in this way,
Dialogue: 2,0:43:17.55,0:43:23.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,it should also raise a lot of red flags that she's willing to help them first of all,
Dialogue: 2,0:43:23.22,0:43:30.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also that this giant group of people is present so close to Jackson without their knowledge.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:30.15,0:43:32.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless Joel and Tommy agree to go.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:32.36,0:43:36.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once you arrive at the cabin, Joel, Tommy, and Abby dismount and settle into the house.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:36.93,0:43:40.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby is clearly distressed, while Tommy and Joel are none the wiser.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:40.81,0:43:44.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, the dread is building.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:44.20,0:43:47.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something is very wrong.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:47.16,0:43:52.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everyone moves into the nearby basement room, and Tommy and Joel introduce themselves.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:52.01,0:43:56.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, this might be construed as out of character
Dialogue: 2,0:43:56.08,0:43:58.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they would use their real names to a bunch of strangers.
Dialogue: 2,0:43:58.65,0:44:01.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in my opinion, it's not actually stretch
Dialogue: 2,0:44:01.29,0:44:06.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,because Tommy and Joel have no reason to believe that their first names could give them away,
Dialogue: 2,0:44:06.03,0:44:09.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,or that one of them is being hunted for that matter.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:09.18,0:44:12.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, they've all done a lot of really messed up stuff,
Dialogue: 2,0:44:12.18,0:44:17.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,but knowing somebody's first name and hunting them down across the country,
Dialogue: 2,0:44:17.40,0:44:19.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,that seems like a bit of a stretch.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:19.20,0:44:20.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,But here we are.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:20.39,0:44:24.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Point is I don't think that it's unrealistic that Joel and Tommy use their real names
Dialogue: 2,0:44:24.88,0:44:28.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,when introducing themselves to a group that seemingly is helping them out.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:28.71,0:44:32.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I have to say it's pretty impressive at how slow and steady
Dialogue: 2,0:44:32.52,0:44:38.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,the dread is building throughout this entire introductory sequence, the prologue of the game.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:38.55,0:44:39.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then at this very moment,
Dialogue: 2,0:44:39.87,0:44:47.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Joel says his name and everybody's faces turn from very friendly to cold and evil.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:47.91,0:44:50.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a moment that I'm not sure I'll ever forget
Dialogue: 2,0:44:50.41,0:44:54.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,the second Joel says his name, the room shifts.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:54.18,0:44:56.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could hear a pin drop.
Dialogue: 2,0:44:56.36,0:45:01.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of being friendly, they all looked at him as though their hyenas looking at their next meal.
Dialogue: 2,0:45:01.53,0:45:07.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's important to note that this kindness that we feel before Joel introduces himself
Dialogue: 2,0:45:07.00,0:45:11.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,is very important and it will come up again later, I promise you.
Dialogue: 2,0:45:11.97,0:45:15.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Joel picks up on this shift, and this plays out.
Dialogue: 2,0:47:45.63,0:47:48.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,We cut back to Ellie, closing in on the cabin.
Dialogue: 2,0:47:48.06,0:47:52.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now right before Joel and Tommy pushed up to the cabin with Abby,
Dialogue: 2,0:47:52.29,0:48:01.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,We saw Jesse come across Ellie and Dina in the basement of Eugene's library in a compromised position.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:01.26,0:48:06.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,He tells them that Joel and Tommy are missing and nobody has seen them since the storm came in.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:06.48,0:48:10.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie becomes panicked and races off to help find them.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:10.35,0:48:13.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's important to note also that Ellie stressed
Dialogue: 2,0:48:13.41,0:48:17.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they should all split up to try and cover as much ground as possible.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:17.16,0:48:19.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Some people have said that this itself is a coincidence
Dialogue: 2,0:48:19.72,0:48:22.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,or a bit of a stretch that they wouldn't actually do this.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:22.37,0:48:23.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,But again, think about it.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:23.94,0:48:26.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,From her perspective, I don't think it's a stretch.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:26.73,0:48:28.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because as far as Ellie is concerned,
Dialogue: 2,0:48:28.56,0:48:33.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's very possible that Joel and Tommy simply had to bunker down somewhere because of the blizzard
Dialogue: 2,0:48:33.80,0:48:36.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,and were caught there by surprise.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:36.27,0:48:42.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not to say that she expected Joel to be hunted by some random chick from Seattle.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:42.15,0:48:46.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless everybody breaks off looking for Joel and Tommy.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:46.05,0:48:50.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,After Abby starts her attack on Joel, we cut to Ellie, closing in on the cabin,
Dialogue: 2,0:48:50.37,0:48:54.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,they give a bit of a fake out here by dropping some ammo right as you enter the cabin,
Dialogue: 2,0:48:54.54,0:48:56.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes the player think that you're about to fight.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:56.70,0:48:58.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,I actually really like it.
Dialogue: 2,0:48:58.08,0:49:00.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,When games do this, do this little fake out.
Dialogue: 2,0:49:00.09,0:49:01.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you're prepped for a fight,
Dialogue: 2,0:49:01.14,0:49:04.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then it's taken away from you, but I know that's just me.
Dialogue: 2,0:49:04.23,0:49:08.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course this is in the case because the second that we enter the basement, this happens.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:15.15,0:51:19.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are some heated discussion between the members of Abby's party as to what to do with Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:19.44,0:51:22.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's all very muffled, and you can't understand any of it,
Dialogue: 2,0:51:22.14,0:51:24.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,though we will get to see this from another perspective later.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:24.90,0:51:26.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Eventually they just knocked her out.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:26.73,0:51:30.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Ellie wakes up after some time to Dina and Jesse rescuing them.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:30.94,0:51:35.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,At this point is not clear if Tommy survived, but it's clear that Joel did not.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:45.39,0:51:51.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,You know what? This is as good a time as any to address the elephant in the room dead on the floor.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:51.12,0:51:52.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,I had the game spoiled for me,
Dialogue: 2,0:51:52.41,0:51:55.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I knew that Joel was going to die at some point.
Dialogue: 2,0:51:55.56,0:51:56.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to be honest,
Dialogue: 2,0:51:56.37,0:52:01.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,many of us had a feeling as though Joel was going to die at some point in the game years ago
Dialogue: 2,0:52:01.83,0:52:03.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it only made sense.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:03.72,0:52:08.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,One of the stereotypes of a sequel is that they're going to kill off one of the major characters
Dialogue: 2,0:52:08.44,0:52:11.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the first iteration of whatever is in question,
Dialogue: 2,0:52:11.91,0:52:15.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether it's a movie and novel, a podcast or a video game,
Dialogue: 2,0:52:15.52,0:52:18.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,time and time again, we've seen this trope played out.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:18.59,0:52:22.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's become a trope because this actually works pretty well.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:22.17,0:52:27.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,You grow the character and the audience falls in love with them over the course of the first story.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:27.00,0:52:30.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then, with this foundation laid you pull the rug out from everybody
Dialogue: 2,0:52:30.86,0:52:34.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,and smack them over the head with a two by four of emotion.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:34.26,0:52:38.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or maybe in this case, a golf club of emotion.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:38.46,0:52:40.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe that's too soon, I don't care, moving on.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:40.62,0:52:46.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,Even with this presumption, having been established by many people before this game was launched,
Dialogue: 2,0:52:46.23,0:52:50.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Naughty Dog seems to have actively tried to dissuade fans from this presupposition
Dialogue: 2,0:52:50.72,0:52:52.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,by way of their pre launch trailers.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:52.98,0:52:59.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this actually got a lot of people pretty upset when they played through the entirety of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0}.
Dialogue: 2,0:52:59.61,0:53:02.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are multiple events that were shown in the trailers
Dialogue: 2,0:53:02.72,0:53:06.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,that aren't actually indicative of what the game has to offer.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:06.45,0:53:08.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,The clearest example would be this one,
Dialogue: 2,0:53:08.86,0:53:12.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,where Ellie is fighting through a bunch of WLF,
Dialogue: 2,0:53:12.00,0:53:15.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then has a hand put over her mouth,
Dialogue: 2,0:53:15.00,0:53:18.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,and when she turns round, she sees that it's Joel,
Dialogue: 2,0:53:18.06,0:53:21.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,telling her that he's not going to let her do this by herself.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:21.39,0:53:24.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I'm not going to respond in the same way that a lot of people on Twitter responded
Dialogue: 2,0:53:24.59,0:53:27.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,where they demanded their money back to the false advertising.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:27.42,0:53:28.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't think that's fair,
Dialogue: 2,0:53:28.86,0:53:32.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially because you paid sixty dollars and have gotten a lot of game play out of it before.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:32.99,0:53:36.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,You know, I don't even need to explain my reasoning, I just think that's stupid.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:36.66,0:53:39.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I will say, however, was that this was very confusing,
Dialogue: 2,0:53:39.42,0:53:42.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least for me, the first time I play through the game.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:42.09,0:53:44.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Having watched all of the trailers multiple times,
Dialogue: 2,0:53:44.85,0:53:50.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,I knew that Joel made an appearance later on in the game because Ellie responds to him.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:50.43,0:53:53.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that never happens in the actual game.
Dialogue: 2,0:53:53.70,0:53:57.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I kept asking myself whether or not there was going to be some sort of dream sequence
Dialogue: 2,0:53:57.69,0:54:00.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,where she plays back through the same level again.
Dialogue: 2,0:54:00.33,0:54:05.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this time Joel is at the end of the line instead, and then that scene plays out.
Dialogue: 2,0:54:05.13,0:54:08.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, I don't have to tell you that never happens.
Dialogue: 2,0:54:08.25,0:54:11.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was simply a way to divert the attention from the fans
Dialogue: 2,0:54:11.86,0:54:14.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,away from what was actually going to happen.
Dialogue: 2,0:54:14.16,0:54:16.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Naughty Dog does have a history of doing this type of thing,
Dialogue: 2,0:54:16.68,0:54:18.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is part of the reason I can't fault them completely,
Dialogue: 2,0:54:18.99,0:54:20.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,because usually it's for a good reason.
Dialogue: 2,0:54:20.64,0:54:23.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,The most obvious example would be with the original {\i1}TLOU{\i0},

Dialogue: 2,0:54:29.91,0:54:32.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it made it so when you actually get your hands on Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,0:54:32.97,0:54:36.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,that sounded weird when I said it out loud,
Dialogue: 2,0:54:36.03,0:54:38.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,it made it, so when you started playing as Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,0:54:38.85,0:54:45.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,the entire sequence was much more surreal because you didn't expect at all to have this opportunity.
Dialogue: 2,0:54:45.39,0:54:47.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another example would be with this very game,

Dialogue: 2,0:55:00.85,0:55:04.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that they only work if people don't know any better.
Dialogue: 2,0:55:04.48,0:55:06.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,And with the original game, as far as I am aware,
Dialogue: 2,0:55:06.99,0:55:11.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,most people believed that you would only play as Joel throughout the entirety of the game,
Dialogue: 2,0:55:11.37,0:55:15.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it made it so when they got their hands on the controller playing as Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,0:55:15.48,0:55:19.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was much more interesting because they didn't expect it at all.
Dialogue: 2,0:55:19.98,0:55:25.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,But with {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} and all of the leaks that followed, people saw this coming from a mile away,

Dialogue: 2,0:55:27.75,0:55:30.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,I've actually spent a lot of time thinking what this game would be like
Dialogue: 2,0:55:30.88,0:55:34.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I had no expectations and nothing spoiled for me.
Dialogue: 2,0:55:34.83,0:55:37.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think the experience would have been much different,
Dialogue: 2,0:55:37.23,0:55:40.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm not sure how that would have changed my perspective.
Dialogue: 2,0:55:40.38,0:55:43.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nonetheless, if you happen to be one of the few lucky people
Dialogue: 2,0:55:43.96,0:55:48.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,who got to play the entire game without having anything spoiled for you,
Dialogue: 2,0:55:48.00,0:55:52.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to hear your thoughts down in the comment section below or in a tweet.
Dialogue: 2,0:55:52.04,0:55:56.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sent it to me, I'm really interested in hearing what your perspective is on all of this.
Dialogue: 2,0:55:56.73,0:56:01.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,But as for Joel's death itself, I have no problem with it.
Dialogue: 2,0:56:01.44,0:56:04.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel's actions throughout the course of the first game were quite reckless
Dialogue: 2,0:56:04.83,0:56:09.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he screwed over a lot of people and killed a lot of people while he was at it.
Dialogue: 2,0:56:09.84,0:56:14.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,I've said before, and I'll say it again: I don't think Joel is a hero.
Dialogue: 2,0:56:14.82,0:56:19.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,If anything, he's an anti hero, if you look at his actions in a vacuum.
Dialogue: 2,0:56:19.38,0:56:25.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can always say that life and morality is much more complicated than looking at it purely in a vacuum,
Dialogue: 2,0:56:25.08,0:56:31.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I think it still stands to say that Joel is not a pillar of morality,
Dialogue: 2,0:56:31.80,0:56:35.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,to which we should all look and pray for guidance.
Dialogue: 2,0:56:35.70,0:56:42.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think rather, he's a damaged, broken, sad and a moral character
Dialogue: 2,0:56:42.55,0:56:48.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,who is looking to do what he needs to do, to survive and protect those he cares about.
Dialogue: 2,0:56:48.06,0:56:51.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's something that I think is in a way admirable in and of itself.
Dialogue: 2,0:56:51.51,0:56:56.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I don't think that that makes you a hero quote-unquote in the same way
Dialogue: 2,0:56:56.30,0:56:59.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,that you could compare a character such as Aloy
Dialogue: 2,0:56:59.37,0:57:04.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,who is actively trying to do the moral thing in any instance that she comes across.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:04.50,0:57:08.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, from a game play perspective, we got our game with Joel.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:08.96,0:57:13.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know him, we have experienced him and his perspectives.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:13.11,0:57:15.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it was time for something new,
Dialogue: 2,0:57:15.00,0:57:20.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if we had played through the entire game as Joel or half and half between Joel and Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,0:57:20.10,0:57:22.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it would have lost a lot of its punch.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:22.47,0:57:27.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Joel's death didn't come as a surprise to me, or probably any one,
Dialogue: 2,0:57:27.00,0:57:29.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially once you walk through that door in the cabin.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:29.94,0:57:36.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,That being said, it's still pretty horrible having to watch him get his head crammed in with a golf club.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:36.00,0:57:39.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's pretty haunting, but that's by design.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:39.12,0:57:44.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Naughty Dog needed the player to be just as haunted by this event as Ellie is
Dialogue: 2,0:57:44.04,0:57:47.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,because then they feel emotionally equivalent,
Dialogue: 2,0:57:47.31,0:57:50.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially in their hatred towards Abby,
Dialogue: 2,0:57:50.04,0:57:54.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is one of the major elements that they need to establish early on.
Dialogue: 2,0:57:54.81,0:58:00.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,You, the player, need to hate this girl with every fiber of your being.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:00.03,0:58:03.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just like Ellie hates her with every fibre of her being.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:03.99,0:58:08.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that later, when they try to flip perspectives and flip the table on you,
Dialogue: 2,0:58:08.88,0:58:10.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,they can do that effectively.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:10.92,0:58:12.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you're apathetic towards Abby
Dialogue: 2,0:58:12.68,0:58:17.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then you go through the entirety of the game trying to pursue revenge,
Dialogue: 2,0:58:17.01,0:58:19.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're not going to be motivated at all.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:19.26,0:58:26.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be pretty uninteresting because the entire premise of the game and the story is a moot point.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:26.01,0:58:32.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you hate Abby, just as much as Ellie hates her and wants to see her die,
Dialogue: 2,0:58:32.37,0:58:35.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,you'll be motivated to get through the first half of the game.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:35.85,0:58:39.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then Naughty Dog has you set up for the final act.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:39.87,0:58:42.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, after this, we enter the end of the prologue.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:42.60,0:58:47.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, we are an hour into this video, and we are just getting out of the prologue.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:47.64,0:58:49.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie and Tommy discuss their next steps.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:49.74,0:58:53.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy talk to Maria, and she's not going to let him go or do anything,
Dialogue: 2,0:58:53.43,0:58:56.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he's not allowed to have any sort of spare men.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:56.55,0:58:58.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,He has to keep them all in Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,0:58:58.41,0:59:00.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,She thinks that they should just move on,
Dialogue: 2,0:59:00.18,0:59:03.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,except that what happened was terrible and go on with their lives.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:03.99,0:59:07.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,As usual, Maria seems to be the one voice of reason.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:07.08,0:59:10.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy and Ellie, however, are understandably upset.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:10.23,0:59:13.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy lost his brother in a terrible way,
Dialogue: 2,0:59:13.26,0:59:17.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Ellie also lost her "father figure" in a terrible way.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:17.76,0:59:20.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,They still aren't certain why this happened,
Dialogue: 2,0:59:20.22,0:59:25.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,or what Joel did that made them seek his death out so fervently.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:25.32,0:59:30.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy happened to see some patches on their coats that read "WLF".
Dialogue: 2,0:59:30.00,0:59:32.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because of his previous history with the Fireflies,
Dialogue: 2,0:59:32.79,0:59:35.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,he knows that that would be the Washington Liberation Front,
Dialogue: 2,0:59:35.91,0:59:38.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a group that's in Washington.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:38.40,0:59:39.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh… Go figure.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:39.54,0:59:43.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's what allows Ellie to know where she needs to go next.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:43.59,0:59:47.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a long stretch that they would have returned to Seattle
Dialogue: 2,0:59:47.60,0:59:49.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that they would still be there and that they would be findable.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:49.89,0:59:54.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when you're motivated this strongly, you're willing to go and try anything.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:54.73,0:59:59.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the same way that Abby was so desperate to go and get revenge against Joel.
Dialogue: 2,0:59:59.93,1:00:04.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie now is motivated to go to her turf and get revenge against her.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:04.26,1:00:08.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Tommy wants to go to Seattle by himself, and Hunt Abby down and get revenge.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:08.82,1:00:11.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maria, of course, is not going to let him do that.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:11.31,1:00:15.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,But Tommy's main objective is to prevent Ellie from going,
Dialogue: 2,1:00:15.54,1:00:19.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,he promised Joel that he would take care of Ellie, no matter what.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:19.23,1:00:22.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case, he knows that if Ellie goes to Seattle,
Dialogue: 2,1:00:22.29,1:00:24.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,her chances of survival aren't very high.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:24.51,1:00:27.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,So he'd rather go take on those chances himself
Dialogue: 2,1:00:27.90,1:00:31.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,and spare Ellie while trying to get revenge for the sake of the both of them.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:31.77,1:00:33.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie demands that they either go together,
Dialogue: 2,1:00:33.69,1:00:36.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,or that Tommy allow Ellie to go with Dina
Dialogue: 2,1:00:36.56,1:00:41.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,and some other people with some troops from the camp to get revenge herself.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:41.13,1:00:46.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy, of course, rejects this idea and asks for and more time just a day or so
Dialogue: 2,1:00:46.36,1:00:48.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that he can try and work something out.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:48.50,1:00:50.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, he's just buying time.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:50.55,1:00:52.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,He's made up his mind as to what he's going to do.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:52.71,1:00:54.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,We then see Ellie in Joel's grave site.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:54.75,1:00:56.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a really touching moment,
Dialogue: 2,1:00:56.22,1:00:59.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it reaffirms that Joel is actually gone.
Dialogue: 2,1:00:59.82,1:01:01.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know about you guys.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:01.35,1:01:06.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I had this sort of surreal feeling when I played through this game the first time.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:06.02,1:01:09.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,I kept saying to myself: Joel can't actually be dead.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:09.16,1:01:14.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,For one because we saw that trailer, where Joel was featured later on in the game in Seattle.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:14.23,1:01:16.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for two because Joel is Joel,
Dialogue: 2,1:01:16.74,1:01:21.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can't just kill off Joel that suddenly, there has to be more to it.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:21.42,1:01:22.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there isn't.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:22.56,1:01:26.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,He's dead. This is his grave and it's sad.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:26.04,1:01:28.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie then visits Joel's house with Dina,
Dialogue: 2,1:01:28.73,1:01:32.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,picks up his watch from the first game, it's still broken.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:32.48,1:01:36.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also takes his revolver, which you'll be using throughout the rest of the game.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:36.30,1:01:39.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's actually pretty cool that this is where she gets it.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:39.63,1:01:43.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,We do this though, only after exploring his house a little bit,
Dialogue: 2,1:01:43.17,1:01:46.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,and there's a lot of incredible detail here,
Dialogue: 2,1:01:46.95,1:01:49.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it really encapsulates Joel's character.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:49.77,1:01:54.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,He's very music heavy and organized his neat and tidy,
Dialogue: 2,1:01:54.66,1:01:58.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and his house is also painfully empty.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:58.02,1:01:59.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's a lot of big, empty rooms.
Dialogue: 2,1:01:59.97,1:02:01.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,And maybe I'm just reading too much into it,
Dialogue: 2,1:02:01.74,1:02:04.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I couldn't help but feel as though there was a lot of space
Dialogue: 2,1:02:04.55,1:02:07.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,where Ellie could have stayed if she had wanted to.
Dialogue: 2,1:02:07.17,1:02:13.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like I said earlier, there was no reason other than the emotional turmoil between the two
Dialogue: 2,1:02:13.76,1:02:17.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,for Ellie to go and live in the grandmother's suite out back.
Dialogue: 2,1:02:17.01,1:02:23.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,But truly everything from the paintings on the walls which we'll come back to later, I promise to,
Dialogue: 2,1:02:23.52,1:02:30.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel's bed still being a little rough and that there is a space magazine and books by his bed,
Dialogue: 2,1:02:30.27,1:02:32.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,that he was reading because he's interested in space
Dialogue: 2,1:02:32.38,1:02:35.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,like it's… it's so cute, and it's so touching,
Dialogue: 2,1:02:35.70,1:02:41.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's so painfully sad to know that he's never going to walk through that house ever again.
Dialogue: 2,1:02:41.10,1:02:42.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,After you grab these items,
Dialogue: 2,1:02:42.66,1:02:47.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,you walked downstairs and realized that Maria is there sitting with Dina.
Dialogue: 2,1:02:47.61,1:02:51.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,She informs you that Tommy left on his own already
Dialogue: 2,1:02:51.19,1:02:55.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,and is asking that Ellie be locked up to prevent her from following him.
Dialogue: 2,1:02:55.83,1:02:59.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maria is understandably frustrated, angry, pissed,
Dialogue: 2,1:02:59.34,1:03:01.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,whatever words you want to associate with it.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:01.89,1:03:04.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,But more than anything, she's worried.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:04.41,1:03:09.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she knows that if she sends Ellie and Dina off to try and help Tommy
Dialogue: 2,1:03:09.93,1:03:11.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least still stand a better chance.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:11.91,1:03:17.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Maria allows Ellie and Dina to leave Jackson with their horses and some extra supplies
Dialogue: 2,1:03:17.09,1:03:22.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,so long as they promised to bring back Tommy, when they return, in one piece.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:22.56,1:03:26.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,This sets up the dual purpose of your journey and theirs.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:26.12,1:03:30.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're going there to kill Abby, but also to save Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,1:03:30.33,1:03:33.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,although Tommy probably doesn't need much saving.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:33.39,1:03:36.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you'll realize that once we get to Seattle,
Dialogue: 2,1:03:36.36,1:03:42.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's going to be a third purpose in their journey and motivation to everything that they're doing,
Dialogue: 2,1:03:42.87,1:03:44.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's added on top of it.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:44.31,1:03:47.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,I find it really interesting that they set up these multiple goals
Dialogue: 2,1:03:47.24,1:03:51.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it seems as though it just complicates things which I actually like.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:51.56,1:03:57.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Having a single quest, we are just going to try and kill one person, is a little bland.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:57.57,1:03:59.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a little uninteresting.
Dialogue: 2,1:03:59.01,1:04:04.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to see that we have multiple things we're trying to do all at once is a little refreshing.
Dialogue: 2,1:04:04.26,1:04:10.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,After this we jumped to the start of the core game itself, Seattle day 1.
Dialogue: 2,1:04:10.98,1:04:15.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after this, we're done with the prologue and ready to move into the core of the game.
Dialogue: 2,1:04:15.93,1:04:20.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,But before we do that, I want to discuss our feelings at this point.
Dialogue: 2,1:04:20.31,1:04:23.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,At this moment in my first run, I felt motivated.
Dialogue: 2,1:04:23.43,1:04:30.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yet still pretty dreadful, in again, the pure sense of the word dread overwhelmed me.
Dialogue: 2,1:04:30.45,1:04:34.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,These revenge quests never end well for anybody,
Dialogue: 2,1:04:34.62,1:04:38.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I couldn't help but feel as though Ellie was going to totally screw herself over

Dialogue: 2,1:04:45.99,1:04:51.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,The player should be just as hesitant and doubtful as Ellie is in this pursuit.
Dialogue: 2,1:04:51.51,1:04:57.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure, Ellie talks a big game and explains how she's going to go and kill Abby without any remorse,

Dialogue: 2,1:05:06.51,1:05:11.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the same way that Abby knew that her plan to just go in storm Jackson
Dialogue: 2,1:05:11.05,1:05:13.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,didn't make a lot of logical sense,
Dialogue: 2,1:05:13.35,1:05:18.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they are going to try and do it because they felt as though it was the right thing to do,
Dialogue: 2,1:05:18.21,1:05:20.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that's what kept them going.
Dialogue: 2,1:05:20.19,1:05:23.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a tug of war of emotions and motivations.
Dialogue: 2,1:05:23.40,1:05:26.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that conflict is what makes an interesting story.

Dialogue: 2,1:05:37.41,1:05:39.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's interesting at least to me.

Dialogue: 2,1:05:56.49,1:06:02.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's with that newfound motivation to find Abby that we enter the core of the game.

Dialogue: 2,1:06:05.66,1:06:09.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we're about to enter a very slow sequence of the game.

Dialogue: 2,1:06:46.17,1:06:49.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for the most part, this is a puzzle solving sequence.

Dialogue: 2,1:07:06.21,1:07:11.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,but instead we're forced to just slowly solved some basic puzzles.

Dialogue: 2,1:07:14.13,1:07:19.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,pull open our note book to look back at what the codes were and then enter those in manually.
Dialogue: 2,1:07:19.29,1:07:20.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not that interesting,
Dialogue: 2,1:07:20.70,1:07:25.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it is in direct conflict with what the player wants to be doing at this point.
Dialogue: 2,1:07:25.59,1:07:28.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,I understand may be Naughty Dog wanted to slow the pace down

Dialogue: 2,1:07:33.18,1:07:37.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,But still, I can't help but feel as though there would have been a better way to do this

Dialogue: 2,1:07:58.68,1:08:03.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,This includes a bank, a synagogue, a court house all very well realized.

Dialogue: 2,1:08:19.38,1:08:23.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I gotta say Naughty Dog is really good at this sort of indirect world building,
Dialogue: 2,1:08:23.22,1:08:27.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,it makes you question your actual priorities in your current life.

Dialogue: 2,1:08:57.75,1:09:01.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,is an optional item interaction in the music store of this section.

Dialogue: 2,1:10:03.52,1:10:06.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,because Naughty Dog did talk these sections up a lot,

Dialogue: 2,1:21:16.44,1:21:20.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now Dina understands that this might actually be true,

Dialogue: 2,1:21:42.06,1:21:43.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just a little strange,

Dialogue: 2,1:21:46.80,1:21:50.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,And perhaps there were scenes that had been written where they discuss it further,

Dialogue: 2,1:21:53.43,1:21:58.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,But all I know is that it seems strange that Dina doesn't engage with Ellie further on this matter.

Dialogue: 2,1:22:50.63,1:22:55.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Naughty Dog was going to have somebody in Ellie's friend circle become pregnant
Dialogue: 2,1:22:55.05,1:22:57.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that they could draw a further parallel later.
Dialogue: 2,1:22:57.69,1:23:00.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure enough, that's exactly what they did.
Dialogue: 2,1:23:00.51,1:23:03.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, Ellie breaks away, allowing Dina to sleep.

Dialogue: 2,1:23:23.34,1:23:27.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's almighty convenient that she hit the radio in frustration in the first place
Dialogue: 2,1:23:27.59,1:23:29.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,because if she didn't, she wouldn't have found the keys.

Dialogue: 2,1:23:46.14,1:23:49.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,She plays the first few bars, and then we cut to a flashback.
Dialogue: 2,1:23:49.83,1:23:53.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,Probably my favorite flashback of the entire game.
Dialogue: 2,1:23:53.43,1:23:55.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's Joel and Ellie.

Dialogue: 2,1:24:09.16,1:24:12.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,because he knew that Ellie dreamed of seeing dinosaurs.

Dialogue: 2,1:24:34.47,1:24:40.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,This sequence is actually just like the arcade one in {\i1}Left Behind{\i0} the DLC from the first game

Dialogue: 2,1:24:59.52,1:25:07.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it just serves to further establish that Joel and Ellie had a deep relationship and care for each other.

Dialogue: 2,1:25:10.35,1:25:15.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because at the very end of this scene you come across a writing on the wall.
Dialogue: 2,1:25:15.87,1:25:21.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,And needless to say, it's something that Joel and Ellie don't want to discuss.

Dialogue: 2,1:26:15.12,1:26:17.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not much happens for around thirty minutes of exploring
Dialogue: 2,1:26:17.78,1:26:21.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,until all of the WLF seems to descend at the same spot,
Dialogue: 2,1:26:21.84,1:26:24.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,a smoke signal that Ellie also follows.
Dialogue: 2,1:26:24.52,1:26:27.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,The level design here is really fantastic.
Dialogue: 2,1:26:27.15,1:26:32.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,This use of a visual objective in the distance that you can follow as you go through the level.
Dialogue: 2,1:26:32.73,1:26:37.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really well done, and it's something Naughty Dog has been doing for a long time
Dialogue: 2,1:26:37.66,1:26:39.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that they really have perfected.
Dialogue: 2,1:26:39.69,1:26:42.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now these level really crescendos in difficulty,
Dialogue: 2,1:26:42.54,1:26:47.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially in harder difficulty settings where difficulty spikes are far more severe.
Dialogue: 2,1:26:47.67,1:26:51.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the thing about this is that you'll get caught with no ammo in this level
Dialogue: 2,1:26:51.54,1:26:54.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you're not careful and use it all too early.
Dialogue: 2,1:26:54.24,1:26:57.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have to be very careful to preserve it.
Dialogue: 2,1:26:57.09,1:27:00.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the problem is on your first run through you're not going to know

Dialogue: 2,1:27:02.64,1:27:03.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,You couldn't have known.
Dialogue: 2,1:27:03.96,1:27:09.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in turn you are always careful and never want to use any of your ammo whatsoever.
Dialogue: 2,1:27:09.48,1:27:12.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when that's the case, you are always careful,
Dialogue: 2,1:27:12.57,1:27:17.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,which also means that you never are because your behavior isn't changing in any way.
Dialogue: 2,1:27:17.10,1:27:18.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are just refusing to use ammo,
Dialogue: 2,1:27:18.78,1:27:21.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you're effectively playing through the game as a melee game.
Dialogue: 2,1:27:21.30,1:27:26.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's this game play hesitance that I have noticed in a lot of horror video games,

Dialogue: 2,1:27:29.82,1:27:36.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's strange to me because I don't think it actually reflects a better game play experience
Dialogue: 2,1:27:36.29,1:27:40.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it just ends up with the player refusing to use multiple mechanics
Dialogue: 2,1:27:40.22,1:27:42.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they are scared that if they do use them,
Dialogue: 2,1:27:42.36,1:27:45.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,they're going to run out of ammo and be unable to use them later on.
Dialogue: 2,1:27:45.99,1:27:51.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I understand that getting rid of this system could also be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
Dialogue: 2,1:27:51.69,1:27:54.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Though regardless, Ellie pushes to the smokestack,
Dialogue: 2,1:27:54.57,1:27:58.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,killing and evading all sorts of WLF members while she goes.
Dialogue: 2,1:27:58.26,1:28:00.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,You eventually unlock the bow and arrow here,
Dialogue: 2,1:28:00.45,1:28:04.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is actually probably my favorite weapon of the whole game.
Dialogue: 2,1:28:04.44,1:28:08.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's silent, you can recollect a lot of the ammo depending on where you hit the enemy
Dialogue: 2,1:28:08.53,1:28:10.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,and on what difficulty you're playing.
Dialogue: 2,1:28:10.86,1:28:14.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all around I just like it, I find it really satisfying.
Dialogue: 2,1:28:14.61,1:28:19.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,She reaches the location of the smoke stack, and then this happens.
Dialogue: 2,1:28:48.00,1:28:53.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is really weird to me… because…
Dialogue: 2,1:28:53.02,1:28:56.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,as far as I knew, this was going to be Joel when Ellie turned around,
Dialogue: 2,1:28:56.97,1:29:01.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I was really confused when I saw that we were getting to that point where the trailer happened.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:01.64,1:29:03.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I knew that Joel was dead.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:03.69,1:29:05.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,How could he possibly show up and save the day?
Dialogue: 2,1:29:05.79,1:29:08.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,But sure enough, it ends up being Jesse.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:08.88,1:29:13.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just strange to me that they chose to do this fake out,
Dialogue: 2,1:29:13.02,1:29:17.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we thought that it was going to be Joel here,
Dialogue: 2,1:29:17.07,1:29:18.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,because that's what the trailer showed,
Dialogue: 2,1:29:18.87,1:29:23.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then it ends up being just… It's just it's weird… It's weird to me.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:23.07,1:29:24.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know what else to say.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:24.30,1:29:27.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have more information on this, let me know in the comments section below,
Dialogue: 2,1:29:27.06,1:29:29.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just…  it's weird. I don't know what to make of it.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:29.64,1:29:33.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nonetheless, Ellie and Jessie managed to escape by way of a stolen car
Dialogue: 2,1:29:33.12,1:29:39.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they drive into a river in a pretty impressive sequence that also leaked pre launch.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:39.48,1:29:43.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a superfluid sequence, and no, I'm not just saying that because they end up in a river,
Dialogue: 2,1:29:43.47,1:29:47.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's very well polished and it looks incredible to boot.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:47.76,1:29:51.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then again, I mean, this is a Naughty Dog game wouldn't expect anything else.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:51.78,1:29:55.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,You bring Jesse back to Dina and there's a ton of tension here.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:55.77,1:29:59.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie, of course, leaves because she feels very awkward.
Dialogue: 2,1:29:59.07,1:30:03.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all Ellie's girlfriend's baby daddy just showed up.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:03.54,1:30:05.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't blame her for wanting to leave.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:05.44,1:30:10.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,As Ellie walks away, we jump into another flashback, and this one's actually pretty simple.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:10.56,1:30:14.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie and Joel are exploring a hotel while on their way to a music store
Dialogue: 2,1:30:14.10,1:30:17.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,after Ellie receives a lesson on sniping from Tommy.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:17.73,1:30:19.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this may seem really random,
Dialogue: 2,1:30:19.14,1:30:25.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially because sniping will not be a major mechanic for Ellie throughout the entire game.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:25.11,1:30:31.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there actually is a reason for them showing the player this sniping tutorial.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:31.02,1:30:33.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll get to that more in a little bit, though.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:33.52,1:30:40.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,After you finish your sniping tutorial with Tommy, ride back down the hill and find Joel sitting there
Dialogue: 2,1:30:40.08,1:30:45.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you prepare to go out with him to find some guitar strings at a music store.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:45.66,1:30:52.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, A fun little detail is that this actually was originally an entirely different plot.
Dialogue: 2,1:30:52.53,1:30:56.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,Originally after Ellie finished her sniping tutorial with Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,1:30:56.55,1:31:03.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,she and Joel were going to go and say Hi to Joel's girlfriend who lived just a little ways down the road.
Dialogue: 2,1:31:03.21,1:31:08.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,They were going to ride up, find Joel's girlfriend having been freshly bitten
Dialogue: 2,1:31:08.76,1:31:11.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they were going to be forced to make a difficult choice.

Dialogue: 2,1:31:15.15,1:31:19.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,they send Ellie outside to grab some fresh water from the stream.
Dialogue: 2,1:31:19.49,1:31:23.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once Ellie walks outside, she hears a gunshot,
Dialogue: 2,1:31:23.01,1:31:27.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then Joel walks out, and they know that something happened.

Dialogue: 2,1:31:29.79,1:31:34.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,And either Joel put her out of her misery at her request,
Dialogue: 2,1:31:34.11,1:31:39.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,or she put herself out of her own misery because she knew that she didn't want Joel have to do it for her,
Dialogue: 2,1:31:39.63,1:31:41.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they knew how this was going to end.
Dialogue: 2,1:31:41.76,1:31:45.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, it would have been a very touching moment
Dialogue: 2,1:31:45.60,1:31:50.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,and interesting thing to see Joel and Ellie experience together.
Dialogue: 2,1:31:50.85,1:31:56.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel experiencing another loss and using Ellie to help him get through it.
Dialogue: 2,1:31:56.07,1:32:03.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,But apparently, according to the press release and comments by Neil Druckmann and all of his writing staff,
Dialogue: 2,1:32:03.81,1:32:07.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,this scene was cut in favor of this new scene
Dialogue: 2,1:32:07.18,1:32:11.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,where they go and explore a hotel cutting through to a music store.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:11.07,1:32:16.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because they felt as though it was too much of a diversion from the priorities of the story.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:16.35,1:32:21.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,In other words, this is a game about Ellie, it's not a game about Joel.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:21.33,1:32:28.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if they had this scene focused on Joel, it would start to feel much more like a Joel AND Ellie Game.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:28.56,1:32:33.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,But a Joel and Ellie game, where your only playing as Ellie, but make of that what you will.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:33.52,1:32:36.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,You cut through the resort, clearing out a ton of infected
Dialogue: 2,1:32:36.42,1:32:40.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it actually feels a lot like the first game, it's pretty nice.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:40.23,1:32:44.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,As they pushed through the resort, Joel insists that Ellie wear her mask,

Dialogue: 2,1:32:47.67,1:32:50.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,she asks why she'd would need to do this,
Dialogue: 2,1:32:50.04,1:32:52.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,after all, it's just them exploring the hotel.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:52.56,1:32:57.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,And he says, because if somebody saw her, they would have a lot of questions understandably.
Dialogue: 2,1:32:57.60,1:33:00.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's better to be safe than sorry, she should just wear it.
Dialogue: 2,1:33:00.66,1:33:02.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this explains why she was wearing it
Dialogue: 2,1:33:02.63,1:33:05.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,and all of the other sequences like we talked about at the beginning.
Dialogue: 2,1:33:05.85,1:33:11.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,She wore the mask at Joel's insistence because she didn't want to risk anybody finding out
Dialogue: 2,1:33:11.28,1:33:13.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it would cause too much trouble,
Dialogue: 2,1:33:13.47,1:33:17.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,or it just wasn't worth the headache of explaining everything that went down with the Fireflies,
Dialogue: 2,1:33:17.67,1:33:22.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if Joel was going to stick to his original story of what happened.

Dialogue: 2,1:33:36.68,1:33:40.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,which spurs a conversation about what happened at the hospital.

Dialogue: 2,1:34:48.98,1:34:51.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is actually pretty quiet chapter of the game.
Dialogue: 2,1:34:51.23,1:34:53.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because Ellie is, of course by herself.
Dialogue: 2,1:34:53.45,1:34:57.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's no one to bounce anything off of, she's just alone.

Dialogue: 2,1:35:04.01,1:35:07.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,The best example would probably be when Ellie walks up to a workbench,

Dialogue: 2,1:35:43.91,1:35:47.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,I… I… I understand this probably pissed some people off when freaked them out.

Dialogue: 2,1:36:51.29,1:36:54.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least in my mind, it makes the game too easy,
Dialogue: 2,1:36:54.38,1:36:59.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though the combat is remarkably hard on, for instance, Survivor.
Dialogue: 2,1:36:59.59,1:37:04.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,Part of the reason this is a problem in my mind is because Molotovs are crafted using the same materials.
Dialogue: 2,1:37:04.63,1:37:07.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,So effectively, the player is always faced with a choice
Dialogue: 2,1:37:07.21,1:37:10.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,between crafting a health kit and a Molotov cocktail.
Dialogue: 2,1:37:10.95,1:37:15.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Seems like a stupid delineation to draw, but I think it's important.
Dialogue: 2,1:37:15.52,1:37:20.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, health kits just represent a major mistake on the part of the player.

Dialogue: 2,1:37:26.62,1:37:30.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're usually just going to reload and save and continue on
Dialogue: 2,1:37:30.53,1:37:33.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,with all the ammo you had before you made that big mistake.
Dialogue: 2,1:37:33.74,1:37:36.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,This means that in my new game plus run on Survivor,
Dialogue: 2,1:37:36.53,1:37:42.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,I almost never crafted any healing kits at all because Molotovs were far more useful.

Dialogue: 2,1:37:49.16,1:37:53.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,and not made that same mistake that landed me in that tough spot.
Dialogue: 2,1:37:53.12,1:37:57.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other piece to all of this looting and crafting crap is that
Dialogue: 2,1:37:57.17,1:38:01.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,looting materials does make it feel as though you are exploring the levels.
Dialogue: 2,1:38:01.04,1:38:05.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it motivates the player to explore the levels in most instances.
Dialogue: 2,1:38:05.45,1:38:10.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the developers used a balanced, dynamic generation system that makes it.
Dialogue: 2,1:38:10.75,1:38:14.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you were preparing to go up against a boss fight, for instance,
Dialogue: 2,1:38:14.99,1:38:18.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,more ammo will generate as you get closer to that boss
Dialogue: 2,1:38:18.43,1:38:23.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,to bring you up to the recommended level that they set for that boss fighting counter.
Dialogue: 2,1:38:23.90,1:38:26.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now of course, nothing is forcing you to pick up these items,
Dialogue: 2,1:38:26.45,1:38:31.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the game will generate them more frequently and present them to you more obviously
Dialogue: 2,1:38:31.49,1:38:34.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,if it calculates that you are in need of them.
Dialogue: 2,1:38:34.22,1:38:38.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,On higher difficulties, it calculates you as needing less of them.
Dialogue: 2,1:38:38.09,1:38:41.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, it calculates you as needing these items,
Dialogue: 2,1:38:41.51,1:38:45.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means that you don't actually have to explore the levels to find the items
Dialogue: 2,1:38:45.65,1:38:47.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,you just have to get to the end of the level,

Dialogue: 2,1:39:00.92,1:39:03.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,But to be honest, I don't think that this is a major issue.
Dialogue: 2,1:39:03.50,1:39:06.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,If anything, it's just a perk for speed runners.
Dialogue: 2,1:39:06.07,1:39:09.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, it probably does more good than it does harm,
Dialogue: 2,1:39:09.64,1:39:14.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it makes it so if players overlooked a certain area that had a lot of gear in it,

Dialogue: 2,1:39:31.55,1:39:37.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the peak of this chapter is when we get our first extensive exposure to the Seraphites.
Dialogue: 2,1:39:37.00,1:39:40.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, they fight differently. They're much more stealthy and careful.

Dialogue: 2,1:39:43.04,1:39:47.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now depending on your sound system, tweaking the audio settings could really work wonders.

Dialogue: 2,1:40:28.99,1:40:31.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a long stretch, if you're playing through on the first run,
Dialogue: 2,1:40:31.98,1:40:34.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it's more of a new game plus problem.
Dialogue: 2,1:40:34.64,1:40:38.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do have it unlocked and you blow up all of the cult members

Dialogue: 2,1:40:43.88,1:40:49.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,he'll actually just hang and it's a much slower and more aggravated death,
Dialogue: 2,1:40:49.10,1:40:51.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,unless you put him out of his misery.
Dialogue: 2,1:40:51.26,1:40:52.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,I actually tested this,
Dialogue: 2,1:40:52.31,1:40:55.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,where I tried to shoot the rope and cut him down to allow him to escape,
Dialogue: 2,1:40:55.64,1:40:57.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I wasn't able to get it to work.
Dialogue: 2,1:40:57.08,1:41:00.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe there is a way to do it, and I just have bad aim on the shore.
Dialogue: 2,1:41:00.53,1:41:05.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, it's still pretty cool that they have two states available.
Dialogue: 2,1:41:05.38,1:41:09.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,For one, if they are able to finish their little ceremony,
Dialogue: 2,1:41:09.32,1:41:13.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,kill him by hanging and disemboweling at the same time;
Dialogue: 2,1:41:13.70,1:41:18.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then the other case being that you kill them before they are able to disembowel him,
Dialogue: 2,1:41:18.23,1:41:22.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,at which point they just kick the bucket out and he hangs slowly.
Dialogue: 2,1:41:22.40,1:41:28.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you fight and sneak through multiple levels of these guys finishing on a mini boss fight
Dialogue: 2,1:41:28.76,1:41:34.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a big Seraphite Brute, the same one that was seen in the Dina Ellie kiss trailer.
Dialogue: 2,1:41:34.31,1:41:38.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it's a little less polished in this final version, at least in my opinion,
Dialogue: 2,1:41:38.99,1:41:41.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's less fluid, but it's still awesome.
Dialogue: 2,1:41:41.99,1:41:47.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I mean by that is that there seems to be a lot less scripted elements and animations.
Dialogue: 2,1:41:47.00,1:41:50.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,But to be honest, you'd probably expect that from a trailer.
Dialogue: 2,1:41:50.09,1:41:52.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now there are grunts in the back room during this fight,
Dialogue: 2,1:41:52.88,1:41:56.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,which actually makes this a really difficult to encounter a new game plus
Dialogue: 2,1:41:56.26,1:42:00.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,considering that I had used all of my ammo by the time that I got here,
Dialogue: 2,1:42:00.65,1:42:04.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,meaning that I had to take him on pretty much entirely with melee.
Dialogue: 2,1:42:04.10,1:42:10.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now one of the frustrations with {\i1}TLOU{\i0} is that it requires a lot of trial and error.
Dialogue: 2,1:42:10.97,1:42:15.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,A lot of the time the only way to figure out exactly how to get through a particular encounter
Dialogue: 2,1:42:15.64,1:42:18.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,is by dying repeatedly and trying again.
Dialogue: 2,1:42:18.65,1:42:21.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,The worst examples would be, for instance, this scene
Dialogue: 2,1:42:21.36,1:42:23.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,where I had to run around into the back room,
Dialogue: 2,1:42:23.69,1:42:28.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,try killing those guys first and then moving outside melee, trying to fight the big brute in the back room,
Dialogue: 2,1:42:28.52,1:42:31.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,trying to fight the big brute in the front room, and then moving to the back room.
Dialogue: 2,1:42:31.70,1:42:35.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,It required a lot of trial and error to figure out the best way to do it.
Dialogue: 2,1:42:35.09,1:42:38.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another example would be when Ellie was trying to get the boat
Dialogue: 2,1:42:38.40,1:42:41.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this flooded mall sequence a little bit later.
Dialogue: 2,1:42:41.90,1:42:44.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's visually fascinating as a scene,
Dialogue: 2,1:42:44.63,1:42:49.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,but on Survivor it took around thirty minutes of experimenting to find the path
Dialogue: 2,1:42:49.61,1:42:52.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,that just narrowly dodged everybody's perception.
Dialogue: 2,1:42:52.94,1:42:55.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even then I'm not convinced that I should have escaped
Dialogue: 2,1:42:55.84,1:43:01.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,because I got in the boat, started it and was spotted and then shot started coming in,
Dialogue: 2,1:43:01.55,1:43:04.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,at which point a lot of bullets definitely hit Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,1:43:04.94,1:43:08.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she probably should have died, but I was still allowed to escape.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:08.74,1:43:12.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,From what I can tell Naughty Dog tweaked their aim while you're inside this boat
Dialogue: 2,1:43:12.88,1:43:15.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,to make it feel as though you are whizzing past incoming fire.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:15.62,1:43:18.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,But here I actually forgot that the boat controls in this game
Dialogue: 2,1:43:18.83,1:43:22.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,are defaulted to the stupidest lay out possible.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:22.37,1:43:25.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I sat there for a second holding down R2 like a chump
Dialogue: 2,1:43:25.35,1:43:29.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,before I realized that it was all steered using the left stick,
Dialogue: 2,1:43:29.42,1:43:31.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,and by the time I figured it out,
Dialogue: 2,1:43:31.37,1:43:34.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,I definitely should have died, but nonetheless I was allowed to live.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:34.34,1:43:37.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the player and Ellie pushed to the hospital after the fight with the mini boss.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:37.97,1:43:40.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,We stealth our way into the hospital.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:40.04,1:43:45.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,We kill this check that is holding the Vita who we will also see again later in Abby's sections.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:45.92,1:43:49.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, she's only in there for a couple of seconds.
Dialogue: 2,1:43:49.13,1:43:52.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we find out that WLF are clearing the hospital, which makes sense,
Dialogue: 2,1:43:52.91,1:43:54.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,they want to make sure that there's no infected here,
Dialogue: 2,1:43:54.80,1:43:59.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they're also taking all of their supplies back to their headquarters
Dialogue: 2,1:43:59.69,1:44:02.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,for some reason that isn't explained.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:02.21,1:44:06.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,Though we will figure it out later on when we play as Abby.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:06.29,1:44:09.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,But as for right now, all we know is that Isaac, the leader,
Dialogue: 2,1:44:09.65,1:44:14.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,ordered that all of the supplies be returned to the centralized location.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:14.36,1:44:15.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we go through a bunch of sequences
Dialogue: 2,1:44:15.88,1:44:19.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we can either stealth or fight our way through a bunch of WLF.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:19.34,1:44:23.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not particularly important, it's just more of the same.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:23.09,1:44:26.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,But eventually we push up to the top floor and find Nora.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:26.96,1:44:29.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's talking with some other WLF about Abby.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:29.69,1:44:32.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,Apparently she's missing and these WLF think
Dialogue: 2,1:44:32.47,1:44:37.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Nora knows something about where she is headed and how she escaped.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:37.22,1:44:40.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a little confusing for Ellie because as far as Ellie knew,
Dialogue: 2,1:44:40.07,1:44:42.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby was one of the head honchos with the WLF.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:42.68,1:44:45.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is she being sought out by some of the members?
Dialogue: 2,1:44:45.71,1:44:47.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why was she imprisoned?
Dialogue: 2,1:44:47.21,1:44:52.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is Nora going to be in trouble if it turns out she knows where Abby is?
Dialogue: 2,1:44:52.97,1:44:55.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's very confusing, but it will make sense later.
Dialogue: 2,1:44:55.76,1:44:57.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,As for the player right now,
Dialogue: 2,1:44:57.02,1:45:01.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,it just seems as though Abby is in some sort of direct conflict with the group.
Dialogue: 2,1:45:01.04,1:45:02.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, for a brief moment,
Dialogue: 2,1:45:02.03,1:45:06.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,I thought that perhaps we were going to pair up with WLF members to hunt Abby down.
Dialogue: 2,1:45:06.92,1:45:09.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, an enemy of our enemy is our friend.
Dialogue: 2,1:45:09.92,1:45:12.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, they're not going to do this.
Dialogue: 2,1:45:12.26,1:45:13.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,You chase Nora through the hospital
Dialogue: 2,1:45:13.79,1:45:17.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,after a brief interaction where she pushes back at Ellie asking:

Dialogue: 2,1:45:53.15,1:45:56.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,since she's going to die from the spores in just a few moments,

Dialogue: 2,1:45:58.31,1:46:02.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,kills some zombies and finds Nora cowering in a dead end hallway.
Dialogue: 2,1:46:02.72,1:46:07.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then this sequence plays out wherein we see Ellie get her hands dirty.

Dialogue: 2,1:48:05.15,1:48:08.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's clearly distressed at what she's just done to figure out where Abby is.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:08.93,1:48:10.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,But she did it.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:10.28,1:48:15.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,And she knows that she's at the aquarium, for some reason.

Dialogue: 2,1:48:19.18,1:48:22.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,what this revenge pursuit is doing to Ellie, physically.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:22.40,1:48:26.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can infer Ellie's mental distress through the dialog and behavior,
Dialogue: 2,1:48:26.09,1:48:28.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's still largely up to interpretation.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:28.61,1:48:32.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,But these physical injuries are visual and apparent.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:32.93,1:48:34.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a brief and quiet scene.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:34.64,1:48:37.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after this touching moment, Ellie and Dina fall asleep,
Dialogue: 2,1:48:37.85,1:48:40.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,which takes us to Seattle Day 3.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:40.49,1:48:42.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,We begin with a flashback to two years earlier
Dialogue: 2,1:48:42.89,1:48:46.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Ellie returned to the hospital from the end of the first game.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:46.08,1:48:50.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,After exploring the hospital, discovering some paper work and eventually recording,
Dialogue: 2,1:48:50.87,1:48:53.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,she finds out what truly happened here.
Dialogue: 2,1:48:53.27,1:48:57.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Joel is forced to tell the truth finally, so as to not lose her forever.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:24.95,1:52:28.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,This marks a significant pivot in Joel and Ellie's relationship.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:28.37,1:52:31.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie is known for a long time that Joel was being less than truthful.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:31.55,1:52:32.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,She had her suspicions.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:32.90,1:52:35.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, even with those suspicions,
Dialogue: 2,1:52:35.15,1:52:39.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,she still gave Joel the benefit of the doubt so as to not wreck their relationship.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:39.50,1:52:44.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, now, with the truth fully released out into the open air, Ellie feels betrayed.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:44.81,1:52:47.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everything she feared is true.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:47.18,1:52:51.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,Perhaps the odds of successfully making a vaccine were not particularly high,
Dialogue: 2,1:52:51.95,1:52:56.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially considering how incompetent the Fireflies were throughout the entire first game.
Dialogue: 2,1:52:56.93,1:52:59.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, it's important to note that with this revelation,
Dialogue: 2,1:52:59.75,1:53:02.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's made clear to Ellie that the odds were not zero.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:02.93,1:53:06.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure, they might not have been great, but they weren't zero.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:06.11,1:53:10.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,That places a huge burden on Ellie shoulders, where she feels a duty to humanity,
Dialogue: 2,1:53:10.73,1:53:17.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,to give her life so that others can live and so that humanity could potentially build itself back up.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:17.03,1:53:20.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's an interesting question, especially when you put yourself into her shoes.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:20.75,1:53:23.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if you were in Ellie's position in this world?
Dialogue: 2,1:53:23.81,1:53:28.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if your life held the answer to the cure for all of this?
Dialogue: 2,1:53:28.67,1:53:33.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,All of the misery could be fixed if you were to sacrifice your life.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:33.44,1:53:38.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now there is an emphasis on COULD because there's no guarantee that it would actually work.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:38.06,1:53:41.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even if a vaccine were successfully developed,
Dialogue: 2,1:53:41.39,1:53:46.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,who's to say that anyone would be able to distribute that vaccine throughout the planet?
Dialogue: 2,1:53:46.07,1:53:51.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, one of the big focuses in {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} is the fact that the world has gone to absolute hell.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:51.62,1:53:55.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,People betray each other left and right for seemingly no reason at all.
Dialogue: 2,1:53:55.61,1:54:00.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Trust is something that basically doesn't exist in this world any more.
Dialogue: 2,1:54:00.05,1:54:03.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,And without a doubt, if somebody were to waltz up to the front of your complex,
Dialogue: 2,1:54:03.80,1:54:08.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,claiming that they had the vaccine, the cure to the Cordyceps fungus,
Dialogue: 2,1:54:08.15,1:54:13.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,chances are you would be highly skeptical and wouldn't allow them into the base at all.
Dialogue: 2,1:54:13.13,1:54:18.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,The point is, I understand that Ellie is frustrated that choice was removed from her,
Dialogue: 2,1:54:18.26,1:54:21.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that decision was made for her.
Dialogue: 2,1:54:21.08,1:54:25.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, even with that being the case, it doesn't change the reality
Dialogue: 2,1:54:25.28,1:54:29.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,that this decision is not as simple as cure versus no cure,
Dialogue: 2,1:54:29.40,1:54:33.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,or Ellie saving humanity versus not saving humanity.
Dialogue: 2,1:54:33.35,1:54:37.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nothing is that simple. Nothing is black and white in this world.
Dialogue: 2,1:54:37.70,1:54:42.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,Perhaps for purposes of general analysis within the story of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0}
Dialogue: 2,1:54:42.38,1:54:46.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,you could point at Joel's actions and say that he damned humanity
Dialogue: 2,1:54:46.10,1:54:50.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the sake of saving one individual that he cared greatly about.
Dialogue: 2,1:54:50.24,1:54:54.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I think there's two sides to the coin and you could say that
Dialogue: 2,1:54:54.25,1:55:00.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if they were able to develop some sort of vaccine, it wouldn't have actually gone anywhere,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:00.59,1:55:04.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,or at the very least it would have been contained within a very small community.
Dialogue: 2,1:55:04.37,1:55:08.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,But at the same time you could also say that if that were the case
Dialogue: 2,1:55:08.25,1:55:13.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if the vaccine were only used within the Fireflies or the WLF
Dialogue: 2,1:55:13.20,1:55:17.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,as they eventually became after being splintered across the country,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:17.66,1:55:21.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you could say that Ellie sacrifice would have been worth it
Dialogue: 2,1:55:21.09,1:55:25.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,because she could have saved dozens or perhaps hundreds or even thousands of lives.
Dialogue: 2,1:55:25.64,1:55:30.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure, it's less than millions or billions, but none the less that's a significant number.
Dialogue: 2,1:55:30.17,1:55:34.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,The broader point is that Ellie feels as though this choice was made for her,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:34.19,1:55:35.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it was,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:35.51,1:55:37.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she feels as though Joel betrayed her,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:37.64,1:55:41.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially considering that he's been lying to her about it for years.
Dialogue: 2,1:55:41.84,1:55:45.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,But after this flashback, we cut back to Ellie waking up in the theater,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:45.29,1:55:47.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she goes looking for Jesse and Dina.
Dialogue: 2,1:55:47.66,1:55:50.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,After a brief conversation about Dina's pregnancy,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:50.36,1:55:53.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie and Jesse decided to push out towards the aquarium together.
Dialogue: 2,1:55:53.84,1:55:56.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,They think that Abby is likely hiding out there.
Dialogue: 2,1:55:56.81,1:55:58.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,They don't know why she would be there,
Dialogue: 2,1:55:58.67,1:56:04.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they don't know why she would be running from or have reason to be afraid of the WLF.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:04.82,1:56:08.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, they seemed to be the group that she originated from.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:08.33,1:56:12.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at the very least it should get the player intrigued as to what actually happened.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:12.44,1:56:13.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I first played the game,
Dialogue: 2,1:56:13.52,1:56:16.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,I thought, perhaps it was that they were acting out against her
Dialogue: 2,1:56:16.32,1:56:20.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,after she took this group AWOL to go and find Joel.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:20.24,1:56:22.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, that doesn't actually make much sense,
Dialogue: 2,1:56:22.43,1:56:26.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,considering that all of the other people that went with her on that trip
Dialogue: 2,1:56:26.20,1:56:29.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,seemed to be operating in their regular profession just fine.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:29.42,1:56:30.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at the end of the day,
Dialogue: 2,1:56:30.95,1:56:35.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,all we're left with is a suspicious absence on Abby's part from the group
Dialogue: 2,1:56:35.48,1:56:39.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,and lots of gossip that's overheard between the characters.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:39.23,1:56:42.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless Ellie and Jesse push up towards the aquarium.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:42.48,1:56:45.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the section in my opinion, is actually pretty unremarkable.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:45.95,1:56:48.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's not a lot of interesting fight sequences here,
Dialogue: 2,1:56:48.32,1:56:52.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,and more broadly, it's just served as a chance for Ellie and Jesse
Dialogue: 2,1:56:52.28,1:56:55.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,to get all of the drama about Dina's pregnancy out on the table.
Dialogue: 2,1:56:55.73,1:57:00.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,Over the course of the sequence, they determined that she has to return to Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:00.50,1:57:01.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's no other way.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:01.60,1:57:07.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,If she is to receive any semblance of healthcare in the lead up to the delivery of the child,
Dialogue: 2,1:57:07.37,1:57:10.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,she's going to need to return to where they came from.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:10.07,1:57:13.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,This, in turn means that this is likely their last chance to find Abby,
Dialogue: 2,1:57:13.73,1:57:15.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,because once they find Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,1:57:15.53,1:57:18.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,they're all going to pack up and head back to Jackson together.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:18.50,1:57:24.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Chances are Jesse and Dina, and especially Tommy, are not going to allow Ellie to remain.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:24.06,1:57:26.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Jesse knows that it's his baby.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:26.18,1:57:29.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, he's heard that Dina hasn't told him that she's pregnant yet.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:29.74,1:57:35.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's keeping it a secret, which seems kind of stupid, but I guess that's just me.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:35.42,1:57:38.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, the motivations have shifted.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:38.27,1:57:43.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Jesse is not as concerned about finding Abby and getting revenge.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:43.07,1:57:47.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rather, he's looking for Tommy so that they can all return to Jackson together
Dialogue: 2,1:57:47.15,1:57:49.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,whereas Ellie claims the same.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:49.01,1:57:53.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, she is much more concerned with finding Abby as we'll see in just a moment.
Dialogue: 2,1:57:53.87,1:57:59.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,This whole climaxes when Jesse and Ellie here over a radio that there's a sniper on the pier,
Dialogue: 2,1:57:59.18,1:58:03.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's taking out a bunch of WLF members in causing trouble more generally.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:03.56,1:58:05.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Jesse and Ellie determined that this has to be Tommy.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:05.93,1:58:10.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's actually a fair point because the WLF wouldn't be sniping themselves.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:10.85,1:58:16.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the Scars don't actually use sniper rifles in this way, so it's likely not them.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:16.85,1:58:19.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's either Tommy or another rogue individual
Dialogue: 2,1:58:19.90,1:58:23.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,who happens to just be sniping WLF members for fun.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:23.45,1:58:26.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course it ends up being Tommy at the end of the day,
Dialogue: 2,1:58:26.51,1:58:30.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's here that we see Ellie make a decision that's much harder to justify.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:30.47,1:58:35.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,She insists that Tommy is going to be OK by himself and that he doesn't need her help.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:35.48,1:58:39.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,While this is perhaps true, it's more the thought that counts.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:39.32,1:58:41.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, Tommy has made it this long.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:41.30,1:58:43.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the fact that he sniping WLF members
Dialogue: 2,1:58:43.96,1:58:48.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,shows that he's at least somewhat confident in his abilities to deal with them.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:48.32,1:58:54.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, Ellie isn't saying this because she wants to protect Jesse or herself, or Dina's well being.
Dialogue: 2,1:58:54.85,1:59:00.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rather, she's seeing it purely because she wants to get to Abby quickly, kill her,
Dialogue: 2,1:59:00.08,1:59:04.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then be able to leave with Tommy, Jesse and Dina back to Jackson,
Dialogue: 2,1:59:04.58,1:59:07.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,having accomplished everything she set out to do.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:07.16,1:59:08.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know about you guys,
Dialogue: 2,1:59:08.45,1:59:09.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,but when I first played the game,
Dialogue: 2,1:59:09.98,1:59:14.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,this was the moment that I immediately lost all sympathy for Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:14.81,1:59:19.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,At this point, she's making, what seems to me, the wrong decision.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:19.28,1:59:27.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's potentially damning all of those that she seems to love, for her own selfish pursuit,
Dialogue: 2,1:59:27.77,1:59:31.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is thematically related to what Joel did in the first game,
Dialogue: 2,1:59:31.34,1:59:35.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,where he seemingly screwed over humanity to serve his own private interests.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:35.84,1:59:38.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,And once again, this is something that they do time and time again
Dialogue: 2,1:59:38.87,1:59:40.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,throughout the course of the game.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:40.55,1:59:47.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's parallels all over the course mirror sequences that are meant to echo what happened previously.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:47.48,1:59:48.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's all over the place.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:48.71,1:59:52.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,Needless to say, Jesse is just as disappointed in Ellie for this decision
Dialogue: 2,1:59:52.70,1:59:55.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the player is likely disappointed in her.
Dialogue: 2,1:59:55.55,1:59:58.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,So he breaks off and goes to find Tommy
Dialogue: 2,1:59:58.33,2:00:01.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,and help him get back to the theater so that they can all leave together.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:01.55,2:00:03.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, Ellie splits off alone.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:03.50,2:00:06.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,And she fights for a boat that she saw driving through a canal
Dialogue: 2,2:00:06.80,2:00:09.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,that she hopes to take to the aquarium that's across the harbour.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:09.98,2:00:14.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this sequence is super tough and especially in higher difficulties.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:14.51,2:00:18.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,It requires an almost exclusively stealth approach.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:18.35,2:00:22.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, thankfully, the designers seem to have anticipated this fact,
Dialogue: 2,2:00:22.49,2:00:25.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why most of the levels have secret passageways
Dialogue: 2,2:00:25.56,2:00:28.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,that you can find to get around most of the enemies
Dialogue: 2,2:00:28.59,2:00:32.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that you either don't have to kill any of them to get through to the next checkpoint,
Dialogue: 2,2:00:32.87,2:00:35.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you only have to kill a select few.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:35.78,2:00:40.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,In my opinion, these are the best designed levels in the entirety of the game.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:40.64,2:00:46.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's where the stealth mechanics really shine, and {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} is at its best.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:46.22,2:00:48.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you continue pushing to the aquarium
Dialogue: 2,2:00:48.71,2:00:52.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you fight your way through several waves of Seraphites,
Dialogue: 2,2:00:52.10,2:00:55.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,take on a Bloater or two, and you solve some environmental puzzles.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:55.76,2:00:58.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nothing too difficult, but none the less they're there.
Dialogue: 2,2:00:58.40,2:01:00.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,You eventually get your boat to the mouth of the harbour
Dialogue: 2,2:01:00.72,2:01:04.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you start heading towards the shore over by the aquarium.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:04.28,2:01:07.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's at this point that Ellie's overtaken with a rogue wave and almost drowned,
Dialogue: 2,2:01:07.94,2:01:12.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,but ends up just barely escaping to the shore of the aquarium outcrop.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:12.05,2:01:17.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I will just say this whole sequence is done so smoothly and beautifully well.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:17.57,2:01:19.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can't complemented enough.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:19.82,2:01:21.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not a game developer myself,
Dialogue: 2,2:01:21.56,2:01:28.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I have delved into a lot of the intricacies involved with designing levels and managing memory systems
Dialogue: 2,2:01:28.06,2:01:31.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,to see what they're able to do throughout the course of this game,
Dialogue: 2,2:01:31.25,2:01:34.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,and especially this sequence is absolutely ridiculous,
Dialogue: 2,2:01:34.43,2:01:38.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I have to applaud all of the developers over a Naughty Dog for their hard work.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:38.42,2:01:39.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,But with that out of the way,
Dialogue: 2,2:01:39.74,2:01:43.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie pushes into the aquarium and finds a few strange things.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:43.52,2:01:45.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are several doors locked,
Dialogue: 2,2:01:45.29,2:01:50.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's lights on and there's bloody instruments strewn across an operation table.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:50.32,2:01:52.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,With the context we have in the game so far,
Dialogue: 2,2:01:52.64,2:01:57.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,we assume that there must have been some strange torture session going on here and nothing more.
Dialogue: 2,2:01:57.83,2:02:02.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, as we'll see later, this wasn't as terrible as it seems.
Dialogue: 2,2:02:02.69,2:02:06.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie climbs into an air duct, and then the following sequence plays out.
Dialogue: 2,2:02:37.04,2:02:39.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,This dog may seem like it's just another dog.
Dialogue: 2,2:02:39.71,2:02:44.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, it was shown off in the trailers, as just some mud that you put down.
Dialogue: 2,2:02:44.15,2:02:47.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, we're going to see a lot more of her later.
Dialogue: 2,2:02:47.13,2:02:51.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie recovers, but here's some muffled voices through a double door,
Dialogue: 2,2:02:51.59,2:02:54.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,She pushes through, and the following happens.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:03.59,2:06:07.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,Needless to say, this is a deeply upsetting sequence.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:07.67,2:06:10.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's one that I personally saw coming a mile away.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:10.61,2:06:13.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see one thing I do know about the writer's over a Naughty Dog,
Dialogue: 2,2:06:13.37,2:06:15.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross,
Dialogue: 2,2:06:15.47,2:06:17.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that they love their similes.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:17.83,2:06:20.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,They loved the reflections between characters.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:20.36,2:06:24.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,It gives you a chance to see how these two different people respond to similar situations.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:24.92,2:06:30.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so whenever you start to see things that are similar or things that characters have in common,
Dialogue: 2,2:06:30.20,2:06:32.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have to assume that the developers and writers
Dialogue: 2,2:06:32.57,2:06:38.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,are going to force those two characters into a similar situation where those similarities can come out.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:38.18,2:06:42.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, Ellie's girlfriend, Dina, is pregnant.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:42.29,2:06:46.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,And one of the first things that we hear about Owen and Abby's group in general
Dialogue: 2,2:06:46.83,2:06:48.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that Mel is pregnant.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:48.87,2:06:51.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,At this point in the game we don't know who Mel is
Dialogue: 2,2:06:51.83,2:06:55.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we're standing on this snowy hillside overlooking Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,2:06:55.49,2:06:58.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I personally knew that there was a very good chance
Dialogue: 2,2:06:58.67,2:07:02.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Ellie would end up killing her pregnant friend Mel
Dialogue: 2,2:07:02.28,2:07:05.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,simply because Dina was likely going to end a pregnant as well.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:05.78,2:07:08.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,And sure enough, when Dina is revealed to be pregnant,
Dialogue: 2,2:07:08.69,2:07:10.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,this point was solidified for me.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:10.47,2:07:15.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now besides the predictability of this plot point, I have to ask one other question,
Dialogue: 2,2:07:15.02,2:07:20.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is whether or not Ellie would have actually killed Owen and Mel if they had tattled on Abby.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:20.93,2:07:24.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,And given what we know about Ellie in this game,
Dialogue: 2,2:07:24.53,2:07:27.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think the odds are pretty good that she probably would have.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:27.60,2:07:31.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's horrible to say, but Ellie was here for revenge.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:31.70,2:07:36.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,She knows that these people were there, even though technically she owes her life to Owen.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:36.36,2:07:40.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,Owen is the one that stepped in when Ellie was on the floor, staring at Joel's corpse.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:40.61,2:07:44.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,While everyone else wanted to kill her to clean up after themselves,
Dialogue: 2,2:07:44.06,2:07:46.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,which objectively probably would have been the smarter thing to do,
Dialogue: 2,2:07:46.97,2:07:49.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially considering how {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} plays out.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:49.91,2:07:53.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, she technically owes her life to Owen.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:53.69,2:07:56.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Even so, I think she would have killed him.
Dialogue: 2,2:07:56.15,2:08:00.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other question that you have to ask is where is Abby and what happened.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:00.14,2:08:01.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where did she go?
Dialogue: 2,2:08:01.22,2:08:04.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,How long is it going to be before she finds out what Ellie is done?
Dialogue: 2,2:08:04.91,2:08:07.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why did she leave in the first place?
Dialogue: 2,2:08:07.19,2:08:09.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it's implied that she's fleeing from Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:09.77,2:08:12.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, this doesn't really make a lot of sense,
Dialogue: 2,2:08:12.62,2:08:16.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially when you consider that she's already fleeing something else.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:16.82,2:08:22.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems as though she's involved in something that's taking her away from her duties within the WLF,
Dialogue: 2,2:08:22.25,2:08:24.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why Isaac seems to be upset with her.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:24.44,2:08:28.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, I think Naughty Dog is trying to keep the story moving along
Dialogue: 2,2:08:28.28,2:08:33.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that you don't think about it long enough to realize that there's got to be more to it.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:33.08,2:08:34.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,And honestly, I'm okay with that.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:34.67,2:08:38.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,Especially because Ellie herself isn't particularly interested
Dialogue: 2,2:08:38.48,2:08:42.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the reasons why Abby is going to the places she's going
Dialogue: 2,2:08:42.04,2:08:45.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,or why Abby seems to be at odds with the rest of her group.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:45.53,2:08:47.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,All she's interested in is revenge.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:47.96,2:08:50.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the last thing about this sequence is that I can't help but feel as though
Dialogue: 2,2:08:50.97,2:08:57.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a little strange that Tommy, Jesse and Ellie just leave after this.
Dialogue: 2,2:08:57.11,2:09:01.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,They see the dead bodies on the floor, and don't do anything more.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:01.64,2:09:04.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,That rhymed, I didn't mean it to rhyme.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:04.19,2:09:06.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry, but I'm… you know what we're leaving it in.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:06.74,2:09:08.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, I'm not demanding an elaborate sequence
Dialogue: 2,2:09:08.83,2:09:12.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we clear the entire aquarium of any sort of bogey
Dialogue: 2,2:09:12.50,2:09:16.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,to make sure that Abby is not some were hiding within the aquarium.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:16.04,2:09:17.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,But at the very least,
Dialogue: 2,2:09:17.84,2:09:22.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,it seems odd that they wouldn't have done a more elaborate check throughout the rest of the building.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:22.07,2:09:27.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,They just find Ellie, and clearly she's pretty shaken up about what she has just done.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:27.62,2:09:29.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they just leave.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:29.36,2:09:33.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,Perhaps at this point, they have just accepted that they're not going to find Abby.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:33.29,2:09:35.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's not destined to be.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:35.12,2:09:37.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that they've done enough damage that they've made their point.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:37.93,2:09:43.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, the scenes after this are actually quite calm and it's fairly refreshing.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:43.55,2:09:46.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,We see Ellie in bed with Dina, and they're just resting.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:46.92,2:09:50.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,After a while Ellie goes, and talks with Jesse and Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,2:09:50.21,2:09:52.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,trying to determine the best route back to Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,2:09:52.97,2:09:56.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,They've officially determined that they can't stay and find Abby,
Dialogue: 2,2:09:56.21,2:10:00.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,but rather need to get Dina somewhere safe for the sake of her unborn child.
Dialogue: 2,2:10:00.44,2:10:03.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,All is normal, until this…
Dialogue: 2,2:11:12.26,2:11:16.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a stunningly sudden and sharp narrative beat.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:16.34,2:11:20.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,I knew something was coming, but I didn't know that it would happen this suddenly.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:20.61,2:11:25.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,Jesse's death happens almost instantaneously as the cut scene begins,
Dialogue: 2,2:11:25.91,2:11:31.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's no warning, there was no forethought, it simply happens and Jesse's dead.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:31.76,2:11:36.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's also a problem with what the fuc… what it…  What is that?
Dialogue: 2,2:11:36.20,2:11:39.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,What it… That's gross. Stop it, OK, OK, a slight detour.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:39.74,2:11:42.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know this is a serious scene and it's sad and everything.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:42.41,2:11:46.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it was almost completely ruined because the first time that I play through the game,
Dialogue: 2,2:11:46.67,2:11:49.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie has a bandage on her arm.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:49.31,2:11:51.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not actually supposed to be there.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:51.32,2:11:54.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's from the previous sequence when she patched herself up.
Dialogue: 2,2:11:54.56,2:12:01.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, it did something strange where it's warped the actual mesh of her arm.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:01.13,2:12:06.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it looks that she has some sort of weird noodle bone disease.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:06.62,2:12:11.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,It… it's bizarre and I wouldn't complain about it,
Dialogue: 2,2:12:11.87,2:12:16.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,except that when I went back through the game on new game plus
Dialogue: 2,2:12:16.29,2:12:19.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,it didn't happen and her arm looked normal.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:19.04,2:12:21.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can tell that this was a glitch.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:21.02,2:12:26.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just a really, really weird one that I don't really know what to make of.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:26.15,2:12:28.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless it… it happened,
Dialogue: 2,2:12:28.16,2:12:33.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I am going to have nightmares about this weird T-Rex arm that she has.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:33.14,2:12:36.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless it happened, hopefully this didn't happen to you,
Dialogue: 2,2:12:36.62,2:12:42.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,but for me it almost spoiled the entire scene because I found myself giggling at her messed up arm.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:42.53,2:12:44.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,But… you know, I'll leave it there.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:44.86,2:12:48.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this marks the end of the first half of the game.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:48.24,2:12:50.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,And don't worry, we're going to discuss midpoint thoughts
Dialogue: 2,2:12:50.97,2:12:56.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,and where I was at in my play through, what my emotions were, what I thought of everything.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:56.06,2:12:58.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,But first, I want to go through the next scene.
Dialogue: 2,2:12:58.11,2:13:05.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see right after Abby kills Jesse, seemingly kills Tommy, and is holding Ellie at gunpoint,
Dialogue: 2,2:13:05.66,2:13:11.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,we jump to a clip of a young, non-yoked Abby.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:11.09,2:13:15.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's looking for her dad, who is in turn looking for some animal,
Dialogue: 2,2:13:15.47,2:13:18.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,that turns out to be a zebra that's just given birth.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:18.77,2:13:24.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's cute, and it's a nice break from the dread that the last ten hours have brought.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:24.06,2:13:29.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Seriously I didn't realize how much of a trudge the first half of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} felt like
Dialogue: 2,2:13:29.93,2:13:34.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,until we got to the sequence and it felt like something straight out of the first game.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:34.73,2:13:42.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie, God bless her, is a really difficult person to relate to in this sequel, at least for me.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:42.03,2:13:44.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the first game, there was something really human about her,
Dialogue: 2,2:13:44.63,2:13:48.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,something that was reflective of all of us.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:48.44,2:13:53.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can all connect with her and we can all connect with Joel in some weird, distant way.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:53.45,2:13:57.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, in the second game, there's not much of that to be seen or had.
Dialogue: 2,2:13:57.89,2:14:02.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless I can't help but feel as though Ellie is painfully unlikable in the sequel,
Dialogue: 2,2:14:02.21,2:14:07.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why it's all the more bizarre to go through the first half of the game with Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,2:14:07.85,2:14:12.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you don't particularly like her, or condone any thing that she's doing.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:12.59,2:14:17.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you reach this point after this character you're playing as Abby
Dialogue: 2,2:14:17.10,2:14:24.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,has killed characters that you really began to respect and enjoy and even love.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:24.92,2:14:31.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now you find yourself relating to her and liking her personality way more than Ellie's.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:31.19,2:14:35.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really bizarre and I think it was half intentional and half not.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:35.66,2:14:41.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I mean is that I think Abby's relatability and likability, was completely intentional,
Dialogue: 2,2:14:41.30,2:14:46.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,that I don't think that Ellie's lack of likability was completely intended.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:46.40,2:14:52.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now of course, at this point in the game, players for the most part are going to hate Abby.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:52.04,2:14:53.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,I wouldn't blame them.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:53.51,2:14:58.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,She killed Joel, one of the most beloved characters in gaming history.
Dialogue: 2,2:14:58.46,2:15:03.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I understand that frustration that now we are forced to play as her.
Dialogue: 2,2:15:03.20,2:15:05.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, they want you to give Abby a chance,
Dialogue: 2,2:15:05.57,2:15:10.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why they rewind the clock to four years before the events of this game.
Dialogue: 2,2:15:10.40,2:15:11.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, as I mentioned earlier,
Dialogue: 2,2:15:11.69,2:15:16.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,I conducted a massive poll of all of you guys to see what you thought of the game,

Dialogue: 2,2:15:20.51,2:15:22.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if it didn't, what it could have done better.
Dialogue: 2,2:15:22.73,2:15:26.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,There were several dozens of questions involved in the survey,
Dialogue: 2,2:15:26.69,2:15:31.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I'm not going to go through all of them, but I will include a Excel spreadsheet
Dialogue: 2,2:15:31.28,2:15:35.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,that you can actually use to sift through all of the answers yourself if you would like to.
Dialogue: 2,2:15:35.66,2:15:38.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's actually a lot of really interesting information in here,
Dialogue: 2,2:15:38.24,2:15:41.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I've spent the better part of a week sifting through a lot of the responses,

Dialogue: 2,2:15:44.66,2:15:46.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,But one of the things that I was stunned to realize
Dialogue: 2,2:15:46.99,2:15:51.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that a lot of people actually gave up on the game at this point.
Dialogue: 2,2:15:51.26,2:15:55.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,They got through the first half of the game enjoyed Ellie's sections for the most part,
Dialogue: 2,2:15:55.55,2:15:59.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,but once they saw that they are going to be forced to play as Abby,
Dialogue: 2,2:15:59.03,2:16:02.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,they felt betrayed and stopped playing completely.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:02.36,2:16:07.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I was going to show some direct quotations from some of the gamers that expressed this frustration.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:07.46,2:16:13.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, many of them had too much profanity for me to comfortably include in this video
Dialogue: 2,2:16:13.70,2:16:16.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,with any hopes of getting monetized at the end of the day.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:16.46,2:16:19.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I am simply going to paraphrase.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:19.13,2:16:23.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you want to read the actual word for word responses again,
Dialogue: 2,2:16:23.27,2:16:27.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll have the entire survey and all of the responses linked below.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:27.56,2:16:31.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,In general, the people that quit the game at this point felt as though
Dialogue: 2,2:16:31.60,2:16:36.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,they were being forced to relate to somebody that had no interest in relating to.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:36.00,2:16:38.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's kind of a bizarre idea when you think about it,
Dialogue: 2,2:16:38.90,2:16:42.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,that somebody would be so upset that they would have to relate to somebody
Dialogue: 2,2:16:42.61,2:16:45.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they would turn off the game entirely and walk away.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:45.26,2:16:46.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,But here we are.
Dialogue: 2,2:16:46.97,2:16:50.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,If anything, it could be construed as a compliment to the character building
Dialogue: 2,2:16:50.92,2:16:56.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the relatability and care that people felt towards Joel initially,
Dialogue: 2,2:16:56.19,2:17:01.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they are so loyal to him and this imaginary character that he represents
Dialogue: 2,2:17:01.97,2:17:08.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they won't even give the time of day effectively to the character that brought on his demise.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:08.84,2:17:14.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I completely understand how polarizing this decision was on Naughty Dog's part.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:14.08,2:17:15.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,It would have been a very early decision
Dialogue: 2,2:17:15.76,2:17:20.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the development process to have Abby and Ellie costars of this game,
Dialogue: 2,2:17:20.08,2:17:24.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the point where they're both playable for roughly half of the game each.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:24.23,2:17:30.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,And thankfully it seems to have for the most part, been done fairly well, at least in my opinion.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:30.47,2:17:34.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,I understand that some people who disagree with the thematic decision at the outset.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:34.70,2:17:38.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's not really the question. the question is whether or not it was well executed.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:38.69,2:17:40.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, once we've gotten through Abby sections,
Dialogue: 2,2:17:40.73,2:17:43.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll be able to talk a lot more about whether or not I feel as though
Dialogue: 2,2:17:43.76,2:17:48.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,they struck a good balance in trying to present both characters equally.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:48.95,2:17:53.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think the biggest problem with {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} has to do was its pace.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:53.09,2:17:59.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,It gets really easy to doze off and lose focus, especially in the last third of the game.
Dialogue: 2,2:17:59.45,2:18:04.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} asks a lot of the player.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:04.01,2:18:09.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not that easy actually to stay intrigued and involved in everything that's going on,
Dialogue: 2,2:18:09.74,2:18:12.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially because it's so emotionally taxing.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:12.59,2:18:15.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, we're going to get into all of that a little bit later.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:15.32,2:18:16.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,As you go through this sequence,
Dialogue: 2,2:18:16.55,2:18:19.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,you eventually find the zebra that's been trapped in some barbed wire,
Dialogue: 2,2:18:19.91,2:18:24.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Abby helps her father with Owen's assistance cut her loose.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:24.65,2:18:27.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,She runs off in cuddles with her newborn in a field
Dialogue: 2,2:18:27.30,2:18:32.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,directly across from the hospital that we saw at the end of the first game, St. Mary's.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:32.81,2:18:36.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,Their group is informed that Marlin's girl just arrived
Dialogue: 2,2:18:36.21,2:18:40.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that it seems as though she actually is immune as they were initially told.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:40.85,2:18:42.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is, of course, Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:42.56,2:18:44.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just as she was found at the end of the first game,
Dialogue: 2,2:18:44.93,2:18:48.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,we then cut to Marlin from the first game, arguing with Abby's dad
Dialogue: 2,2:18:48.74,2:18:52.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,about whether or not to perform the operation that could lead to a vaccine.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:52.37,2:18:54.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's actually the conversation that we always wanted to hear.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:54.92,2:18:56.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see Abby's dad wants to do it.
Dialogue: 2,2:18:56.93,2:19:00.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,He feels as though the sacrifice of Ellie is going to be worth it
Dialogue: 2,2:19:00.07,2:19:03.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it could potentially save thousands or even millions of lives.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:03.80,2:19:07.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,The problem is that they can't afford to ask Ellie or Joel.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:07.82,2:19:10.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,They have to do it and ask for forgiveness.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:10.52,2:19:13.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,If they were to ask Ellie, she would likely say yes.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:13.76,2:19:17.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if they were to ask Joel, he would likely say no.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:17.15,2:19:21.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as we found out, he would also likely go berserk.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:21.53,2:19:26.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's at the end of this discussion that Abby comes in the room, bringing her father some dinner.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:26.06,2:19:29.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,And she offers a fairly interesting anecdote.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:46.64,2:19:51.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Immediately after this, we cut to black and we transitioned the Abby running into the operating room.
Dialogue: 2,2:19:51.68,2:19:53.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,Finding her dad, dead.
Dialogue: 2,2:20:15.02,2:20:18.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is why Abby wanted to kill Joel.
Dialogue: 2,2:20:18.29,2:20:23.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,This made all the clear by the immediate cut to Joel's death to reaffirm the point.
Dialogue: 2,2:20:23.30,2:20:25.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,It may seem a little ham fisted, but I actually really like this,
Dialogue: 2,2:20:25.82,2:20:29.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,because now we can hear this sequence without the murmur and drowning out
Dialogue: 2,2:20:29.56,2:20:31.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we had the first time that we saw it.
Dialogue: 2,2:20:31.82,2:20:36.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we can hear the entire conversation, the debate that goes back and forth.
Dialogue: 2,2:21:24.56,2:21:27.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the midpoint of the game, really.
Dialogue: 2,2:21:27.62,2:21:30.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,As far as we can tell, we're done playing as Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,2:21:30.95,2:21:34.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,The next sequence pops up with "Seattle Day 1",
Dialogue: 2,2:21:34.10,2:21:38.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,implying that we're going to be going back through the entirety of what we just did with Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,2:21:38.57,2:21:40.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,but from Abby's perspective.
Dialogue: 2,2:21:40.73,2:21:41.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's an interesting flip,
Dialogue: 2,2:21:41.98,2:21:48.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the change of perspective is, after all, the operative narrative element of this entire game's design.
Dialogue: 2,2:21:48.80,2:21:53.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I can't help but feel as though many players are going to already be exhausted
Dialogue: 2,2:21:53.28,2:21:55.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the journey that they just endeavored on.
Dialogue: 2,2:21:55.67,2:21:59.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is why at this point in the game, pace is more important than ever.
Dialogue: 2,2:21:59.12,2:22:01.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to keep the player engaged,
Dialogue: 2,2:22:01.25,2:22:04.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially because many of us probably felt as though
Dialogue: 2,2:22:04.36,2:22:07.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,we had just played through an entire game by itself.
Dialogue: 2,2:22:07.16,2:22:12.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now you're asking us to play through another game with another character,
Dialogue: 2,2:22:12.68,2:22:15.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,but in this case, the villain, as far as we're concerned,
Dialogue: 2,2:22:15.72,2:22:19.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you want us to give her the same time of day and attention that we give Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,2:22:19.85,2:22:23.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,a character that we have a deep relationship built up with
Dialogue: 2,2:22:23.10,2:22:26.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,after having played a game with her back in 2013.
Dialogue: 2,2:22:26.93,2:22:28.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,It really is a lot to ask,
Dialogue: 2,2:22:28.46,2:22:32.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I don't really blame a lot of players that decided to walk away at this point.
Dialogue: 2,2:22:32.75,2:22:36.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure, they may never get the actual story resolved with what happened
Dialogue: 2,2:22:36.91,2:22:39.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,when that Abby pulled the gun on Ellie in the theater,
Dialogue: 2,2:22:39.95,2:22:45.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,or perhaps they simply fast forwarded and watched a run through of the game after that point.
Dialogue: 2,2:22:45.02,2:22:51.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,And lastly, most players are going to have a very skeptical outlook at this second half.
Dialogue: 2,2:22:51.11,2:22:54.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're all looking for reasons to dislike Abby.
Dialogue: 2,2:22:54.53,2:22:59.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, she's done something that we would deem most likely unforgivable.
Dialogue: 2,2:22:59.63,2:23:04.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I would like to think that most of us would have an open enough mind to play through this
Dialogue: 2,2:23:04.34,2:23:08.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,and see whether or not they could be convinced of whether or not she was justified.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:08.90,2:23:10.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,In that survey I conducted,
Dialogue: 2,2:23:10.44,2:23:15.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,it seemed as though the overwhelming majority of people that decided to walk away from the game
Dialogue: 2,2:23:15.59,2:23:18.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,didn't play it after this particular point,
Dialogue: 2,2:23:18.74,2:23:25.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,and those people tended to rate the game very negatively, averaging around a 4 to 5.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:25.61,2:23:29.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, of the people that played the game all the way through,
Dialogue: 2,2:23:29.04,2:23:33.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,the majority of them rated the game in the range of an 8 to 9.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:33.28,2:23:35.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,Seems to be the conclusion is fairly clear.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:35.90,2:23:39.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,Those that gave the game the chance to prove itself to them
Dialogue: 2,2:23:39.36,2:23:42.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,ended up enjoying it once they experienced the whole thing.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:42.77,2:23:45.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whereas those that decided to cut and run
Dialogue: 2,2:23:45.01,2:23:48.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,had the experience that you would expect from somebody who cuts and runs.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:48.44,2:23:50.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,It really is that simple.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:50.09,2:23:55.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to give a game like this the chance to do its job.
Dialogue: 2,2:23:55.31,2:23:59.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,What they're trying to do is convince you that a character you hate
Dialogue: 2,2:23:59.42,2:24:03.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,is actually a human being that has feelings and emotions
Dialogue: 2,2:24:03.34,2:24:08.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,that are perhaps just as justified as the character you'd find relatable.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:08.06,2:24:12.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,That argument isn't made over the course of an hour gameplay sequence.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:12.98,2:24:16.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,It takes time and it takes a lot of effort.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:16.43,2:24:20.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,And more than anything, it takes the open mind of the observer.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:20.63,2:24:23.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,It may seem like a cliche for many people to say
Dialogue: 2,2:24:23.44,2:24:27.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,"Well, if you didn't like {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} when you quit halfway through,
Dialogue: 2,2:24:27.32,2:24:30.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,you just didn't get it, and you were never going to like it".
Dialogue: 2,2:24:30.14,2:24:32.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I think there is a fair amount of truth in that.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:32.99,2:24:34.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I don't know, let me know what you think.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:34.76,2:24:41.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I do know is that at this point, in my first run of the game, I was highly exhausted.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:41.30,2:24:47.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby Sequences required a lot of effort, both emotionally and physically, to get through.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:47.96,2:24:50.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,With the emotional tension and all of the gore,
Dialogue: 2,2:24:50.99,2:24:54.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's an exhausting 10 to 15 hours of game play to get through.
Dialogue: 2,2:24:54.98,2:25:01.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I will be honest, even I considered taking a break before continuing on with Abby sequences.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:01.10,2:25:05.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I decided to put my head down and give the game the chance that it was asking for.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:05.78,2:25:09.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless, this is the time when we begin playing as Abby.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:09.65,2:25:14.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,The pace changes, the attitude changes, the tone changes.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:14.13,2:25:19.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,And more broadly, even the style of character work changes.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:19.52,2:25:25.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,In many ways, it's going to feel like a different game entirely both for better and worse.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:25.01,2:25:27.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, we're going to get into all of it.

Dialogue: 2,2:25:35.87,2:25:38.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, this might change by the time we get to the end.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:38.99,2:25:42.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,This whole game is, of course, about perspective in relativism,
Dialogue: 2,2:25:42.29,2:25:44.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,and to that extent it works fairly simply.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:44.78,2:25:46.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to be forced to play as Abby
Dialogue: 2,2:25:46.96,2:25:53.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least until we either start to enjoy her as a character like her or even love her,
Dialogue: 2,2:25:53.75,2:25:57.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, until we forget how much we hate her.
Dialogue: 2,2:25:57.80,2:25:59.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not going to happen instantly,
Dialogue: 2,2:25:59.18,2:26:02.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,but over the course of the next 8 to 12 hours of game play,
Dialogue: 2,2:26:02.78,2:26:07.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're probably going to start to lose the hatred you felt for her at one point.
Dialogue: 2,2:26:07.24,2:26:11.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here Abby is paired with Manny, who was one of the assailants in Jackson.

Dialogue: 2,2:26:57.57,2:27:00.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once again, it's a little surreal.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:00.14,2:27:04.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,You just saw this woman get murdered, and Ellie freak out as a result,
Dialogue: 2,2:27:04.79,2:27:10.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you also know that Abby freaked out as a result of Ellie's actions towards Mel and Owen,
Dialogue: 2,2:27:10.73,2:27:16.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,so to see her seemingly fine in this particular instance, is a little startling.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:16.73,2:27:20.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nonetheless, Abby and Manny debate for a brief moment
Dialogue: 2,2:27:20.28,2:27:22.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,as to whether or not Mel should be allowed to go with them.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:22.55,2:27:26.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, she's pretty damn pregnant, as you can probably see.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:26.39,2:27:29.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they dismiss it because they don't expect to see any action.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:29.36,2:27:31.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're basically just going to go on a quick patrol,
Dialogue: 2,2:27:31.73,2:27:34.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,make sure that there's nothing to concerning out there,
Dialogue: 2,2:27:34.25,2:27:36.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if there is, they're going to call in support,
Dialogue: 2,2:27:36.38,2:27:39.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,at which point it wouldn't actually matter that Mel is there.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:39.35,2:27:44.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,In my opinion, it's still a stupid decision to bring what is a very pregnant woman
Dialogue: 2,2:27:44.40,2:27:49.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,on what is effectively a military mission to scout out the surrounding area.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:50.54,2:27:53.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's just me, and it's actually Abby too.
Dialogue: 2,2:27:53.45,2:27:59.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the end of this sequence, Abby actually gives Manny crap for having brought Mel along
Dialogue: 2,2:27:59.07,2:28:02.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and says that she definitely should never have been allowed to come in the first place.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:02.93,2:28:06.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, they allowed her to go, from the outset.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:06.60,2:28:12.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, while speaking of Mel, the fact that she's pregnant and we just saw her get murdered by Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,2:28:12.26,2:28:15.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's also important that we addressed the elephant in the room
Dialogue: 2,2:28:15.20,2:28:17.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,that some have said actually ruins the game.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:17.99,2:28:23.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is that knowing what's going to happen removes all of the stakes in the story.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:23.24,2:28:28.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,After Ellie's whole half of the game, we know that most of these characters are going to die.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:28.57,2:28:32.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,And more importantly, we know how they're going to die and when they're going to die.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:32.89,2:28:39.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so going through these sequences where we're trying to protect them or do things with and for them,
Dialogue: 2,2:28:39.17,2:28:43.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,it removes a lot of the tension, since we know how it's all going to end.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:43.01,2:28:46.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I strongly disagree with this idea.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:46.94,2:28:53.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are countless stories where the conclusion is known before the story even really begins.
Dialogue: 2,2:28:53.03,2:28:57.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could look at something as simple and kitschy as the movie Titanic,
Dialogue: 2,2:28:57.05,2:29:02.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,a fascinating film about an albeit cheesy and captivating romance.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:02.48,2:29:06.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,But at its core, we all know how that story is going to end.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:06.59,2:29:10.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Titanic is not magically going to make it back to New York,
Dialogue: 2,2:29:10.55,2:29:15.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,but rather it's going down and many people are going to die.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:15.14,2:29:18.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's still an interesting and captivating story
Dialogue: 2,2:29:18.35,2:29:22.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's not actually about the destination that the story reaches.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:22.33,2:29:24.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's about the journey to that destination.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:24.86,2:29:28.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or in a gaming example, we could look at {\i1}God of War{\i0} from 2018.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:28.88,2:29:34.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know from the beginning of the game that the story is going to end with Kratos and Atreus

Dialogue: 2,2:29:38.04,2:29:40.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know the ending from the start.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:40.49,2:29:45.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,and yet the story is still captivating because it's not just about reaching that destination.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:45.76,2:29:48.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, to me this seems fairly obvious,
Dialogue: 2,2:29:48.65,2:29:55.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it is actually a pretty common accusation against stories that have presumed endings.
Dialogue: 2,2:29:55.68,2:29:58.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,In my mind, if you're going to allow a story to be ruined,
Dialogue: 2,2:29:58.64,2:30:03.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,simply because you know how the characters are going to end up at the end of that story,
Dialogue: 2,2:30:03.41,2:30:09.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're not actually engaging and absorbing the media in the correct,
Dialogue: 2,2:30:09.56,2:30:11.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, most effective way.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:11.63,2:30:16.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, Abby leaves on the back of a truck out on patrol with Manny, and Mel
Dialogue: 2,2:30:16.76,2:30:19.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,and of course, the dog, Alice.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:19.63,2:30:24.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, I said, that that dog that we found in the aquarium earlier that

Dialogue: 2,2:30:28.01,2:30:31.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,well… yeah, this… this is actually the same dog.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:31.28,2:30:36.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's Alice, and she's cute and lovable, and Ellie kills the crap out of her.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:36.67,2:30:38.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby and Mel talk about how they're doing.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:38.63,2:30:43.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Apparently everybody's been struggling with sleep ever since they killed Joel in Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:43.76,2:30:49.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby and Owen are also going out on countless open assignments trying to keep busy
Dialogue: 2,2:30:49.02,2:30:52.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,and exhaust themselves to the point where they don't have to think about what they've done.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:52.52,2:30:54.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are hardened militaristic people
Dialogue: 2,2:30:54.72,2:30:58.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the fact that they're so torn up over what they did to Joel.
Dialogue: 2,2:30:58.82,2:31:00.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's interesting.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:00.03,2:31:03.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because at the very least, it shows that they were somewhat distressed by what they did
Dialogue: 2,2:31:03.88,2:31:05.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,and perhaps even some of them regretted.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:05.75,2:31:10.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the first step towards humanizing these people that you wanted to villainize from the start.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:10.70,2:31:12.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's subtle, but it works.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:12.89,2:31:17.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,It also breaks the perception that Abby and the crew are simply cold blooded killers.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:17.66,2:31:20.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're humans, and yeah, they do so messed up stuff.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:20.30,2:31:24.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,But some of them can feel regret over something that they felt was unjust.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:24.56,2:31:27.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or at the very least, a bad choice.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:27.23,2:31:32.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, this gets interrupted by a group of Seraphites, ambushing the group on horseback.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:32.93,2:31:35.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,I personally hate these sequences.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:35.45,2:31:41.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,The aiming is awkward, the damage feels unfair, and often it's just generally awkward.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:41.48,2:31:43.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we compare it to other car sequences,
Dialogue: 2,2:31:43.37,2:31:48.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,like the one earlier with Jesse traveling all the way down into the river.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:48.65,2:31:50.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not quite the same.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:50.84,2:31:55.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,The one with Ellie and Jesse is very scripted from start to finish
Dialogue: 2,2:31:55.62,2:31:58.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,and feels fair because it's so heavily scripted.
Dialogue: 2,2:31:58.40,2:32:00.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,The player doesn't actually have that much agency.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:00.89,2:32:06.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, if you don't do anything in this car sequence when you're ambushed by the Seraphites
Dialogue: 2,2:32:06.92,2:32:09.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to be killed and have to reload.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:09.88,2:32:14.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have to be actively engaging with the game in its most awkward state,
Dialogue: 2,2:32:14.75,2:32:20.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,which to me means that it's subject and worthy of criticism since you're forced to engage with it.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:20.72,2:32:23.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, Abby and her group eventually get to safety.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:23.72,2:32:25.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,You push through several different buildings,
Dialogue: 2,2:32:25.61,2:32:30.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,and after fighting through multiple waves of infected and more Seraphites,
Dialogue: 2,2:32:30.29,2:32:35.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,you find yourself in a gas station being ambushed by yet another wave of Seraphites.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:35.18,2:32:37.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now a lot of this just feels like bloat.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:37.49,2:32:39.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when we're talking about pacing,
Dialogue: 2,2:32:39.26,2:32:44.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's the last thing that you want to be thinking when going through this stage of the game,
Dialogue: 2,2:32:44.93,2:32:50.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,players need to be more engaged than they have been in the entire game to this point.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:50.06,2:32:55.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I think most people are going to start to feel bored because it just feels like more of the same.
Dialogue: 2,2:32:55.37,2:32:57.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are some interesting moments of levity,
Dialogue: 2,2:32:57.29,2:33:01.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and there are moments where these characters are actually humanized a lot,
Dialogue: 2,2:33:01.10,2:33:04.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is perhaps more the point of this section of the game.
Dialogue: 2,2:33:04.73,2:33:07.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not really about keeping the player super engaged,
Dialogue: 2,2:33:07.37,2:33:12.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's about making sure that the player starts to relate to these people that they previously hated.
Dialogue: 2,2:33:12.23,2:33:18.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know it's a lot to ask that we get both an interesting game play sequence that keeps the player engaged
Dialogue: 2,2:33:18.17,2:33:20.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,and humanizing sequences with these characters.
Dialogue: 2,2:33:20.99,2:33:24.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, I wish that there were something a little bit more engaging.
Dialogue: 2,2:33:24.62,2:33:28.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,My favorite part is probably when Abby is discussing her fear of heights with Mel.
Dialogue: 2,2:33:28.94,2:33:32.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a small moment, and it's something that could be easily missed,
Dialogue: 2,2:33:32.39,2:33:34.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I actually find it really endearing.
Dialogue: 2,2:34:01.58,2:34:05.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once you at the gas station and after a shoot out in a rail yard,
Dialogue: 2,2:34:05.33,2:34:06.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,a crew of WLF members,

Dialogue: 2,2:34:27.98,2:34:33.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the last 12 or so hours of gameplay since Ellie got to Seattle.
Dialogue: 2,2:34:33.51,2:34:36.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the way up to see Isaac Abby and Manny are told
Dialogue: 2,2:34:36.23,2:34:39.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Owen was actually off with another member of the squad,
Dialogue: 2,2:34:39.86,2:34:45.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that he shot that guy, Danny in order to save quote unquote "some Scar".
Dialogue: 2,2:34:45.89,2:34:50.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,Needless to say, this could lead to a death sentence for Owen if proven true.
Dialogue: 2,2:34:50.48,2:34:52.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't really know what exactly happened.
Dialogue: 2,2:34:52.43,2:34:55.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if Owen did actually kill a WLF member

Dialogue: 2,2:35:03.08,2:35:05.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so Abby and Manny head up to talk with Isaac
Dialogue: 2,2:35:05.88,2:35:10.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Isaac probably has the most badass introduction of any character in this game.
Dialogue: 2,2:36:00.47,2:36:03.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Isaac doesn't want them to go and save Owen
Dialogue: 2,2:36:03.24,2:36:08.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they are revving up for some big assault on the Scars, and he can't spare them.
Dialogue: 2,2:36:08.03,2:36:11.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby says "Screw it" and they go after him anyways,
Dialogue: 2,2:36:11.17,2:36:13.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,because why not?
Dialogue: 2,2:36:13.04,2:36:14.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now there's two things about this.
Dialogue: 2,2:36:14.27,2:36:18.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,For one, Abby leaving the group to go and find Owen
Dialogue: 2,2:36:18.34,2:36:22.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,explains why she seems to have gone AWOL in all of those sequences,
Dialogue: 2,2:36:22.46,2:36:25.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Ellie was trying to figure out what was going on;
Dialogue: 2,2:36:25.25,2:36:27.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,and why Abby was not with the rest of the group.
Dialogue: 2,2:36:27.62,2:36:30.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,The WLF were upset with her and wanted to hunt her down
Dialogue: 2,2:36:30.73,2:36:34.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,because she went AWOL and disobeyed Isaac's orders.
Dialogue: 2,2:36:34.19,2:36:37.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,This, of course, doesn't mean that she's not a threat to Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,2:36:37.22,2:36:42.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it does mean that she's not as interested in simply pursuing the goals
Dialogue: 2,2:36:42.56,2:36:47.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and hopes and aspirations of the WLF as Ellie perhaps initially thought.
Dialogue: 2,2:36:47.19,2:36:49.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby is much more of an individual,
Dialogue: 2,2:36:49.08,2:36:53.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,and perhaps that's even something that Ellie and Abby have in common.
Dialogue: 2,2:36:53.06,2:36:57.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other thing about this is that it seems relatively easy for Abby to go AWOL
Dialogue: 2,2:36:57.76,2:37:00.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,and disobey direct orders like this.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:00.35,2:37:02.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe it's just that she's particularly capable,
Dialogue: 2,2:37:02.96,2:37:05.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so she was able to sneak out with any major issue.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:05.96,2:37:09.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,But she also doesn't seem particularly threatened by Isaac,
Dialogue: 2,2:37:09.02,2:37:14.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is strange considering that our introduction to him is of him torturing a guy.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:14.51,2:37:18.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,So whether its hubris or simply a lack of consideration,
Dialogue: 2,2:37:18.59,2:37:22.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby breaks out and decides to go find Owen herself.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:22.31,2:37:25.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,Her hope, of course, being that she's going to be able to save Owen

Dialogue: 2,2:37:29.33,2:37:32.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that she's never realized to have gone missing.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:32.00,2:37:37.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,We then have a quick cutaway where we go to a short date between Abby and Owen.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:37.30,2:37:40.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're on a Ferris wheel, and it's actually super cute.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:40.49,2:37:43.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once again we see that Abby is terrified of heights,
Dialogue: 2,2:37:43.19,2:37:49.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's again a humanizing moment to see her chilling with Owen and also freaked out.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:49.46,2:37:54.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, once again, this is a point when the pace really starts to come into question.
Dialogue: 2,2:37:54.59,2:37:58.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the deal here? Why is it moving so slowly?
Dialogue: 2,2:37:58.46,2:38:02.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why are we going through all of these cutaways with characters we don't particularly know,
Dialogue: 2,2:38:02.87,2:38:06.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,and most people probably don't care that much about yet?

Dialogue: 2,2:43:27.82,2:43:30.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,is phenomenal and I can't applauded enough.

Dialogue: 2,2:45:22.07,2:45:26.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,This also reminded me of a flashback when Ellie and Joel were climbing through a crack in the wall,

Dialogue: 2,2:46:44.92,2:46:48.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,and simply turn them into a trophy on your Playstation achievements list.

Dialogue: 2,2:48:44.48,2:48:50.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,Specifically because it makes it so that the Seraphites followers are much more relatable and sympathetic.
Dialogue: 2,2:48:50.42,2:48:51.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whenever you feel as though
Dialogue: 2,2:48:51.72,2:48:57.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,they're employing some very animalistic and barbarian tactic to achieve a certain ends,
Dialogue: 2,2:48:57.38,2:49:03.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,such as gutting somebody to release them into the heavens for some reason,
Dialogue: 2,2:49:03.11,2:49:05.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can always fall back and partially excuse it
Dialogue: 2,2:49:05.92,2:49:10.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,because these are people simply following directions that they believe are coming from on high.
Dialogue: 2,2:49:10.94,2:49:15.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,Most of the Seraphites aren't viciously evil and despicable people
Dialogue: 2,2:49:15.94,2:49:19.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,trying to do despicable things because they enjoy it.
Dialogue: 2,2:49:19.31,2:49:25.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rather, they're people simply trying to survive in a world that's really really messed up.
Dialogue: 2,2:49:25.10,2:49:28.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's no mystery that this is set up right around the time
Dialogue: 2,2:49:28.16,2:49:35.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Abby is starting to feel sympathy towards members, or in this case, former members of the cult.
Dialogue: 2,2:49:35.39,2:49:37.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again this game is all about perspectives.
Dialogue: 2,2:49:37.88,2:49:40.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's all about trying to get you to sympathize with people
Dialogue: 2,2:49:40.91,2:49:44.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,that you didn't think you could possibly sympathize with before.
Dialogue: 2,2:49:44.28,2:49:47.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,The point is, the Prophet is a very interesting character,
Dialogue: 2,2:49:47.93,2:49:53.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,specifically considering the control that she seems to have over the Seraphites.
Dialogue: 2,2:49:53.36,2:49:58.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, without many details on exactly when she died or how she died,
Dialogue: 2,2:49:58.16,2:50:01.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's unclear at just how long she's been gone.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:01.52,2:50:04.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,It would be one thing if she had been dead for just a few years,
Dialogue: 2,2:50:04.82,2:50:07.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is what's starting to ramp up.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:07.28,2:50:12.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's an entirely another case for her to have been dead for ten or fifteen years,
Dialogue: 2,2:50:12.29,2:50:18.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,leading to over a decade of power struggles, which eventually bred this new, morphed cult.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:18.62,2:50:21.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, I think the Seraphites are fairly interesting.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:21.83,2:50:23.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the very least they are a little bit different,
Dialogue: 2,2:50:23.68,2:50:25.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they offer a fresh perspective
Dialogue: 2,2:50:25.76,2:50:31.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,on how a group of people might go about surviving in a world that's this messed up.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:31.04,2:50:36.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,I especially like it because so often these types of narratives are completely drowned out
Dialogue: 2,2:50:36.84,2:50:42.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,with cannibals and barbarians and looters and raiders,
Dialogue: 2,2:50:42.11,2:50:45.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,and basically everybody that you encountered in the first game.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:45.29,2:50:49.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's only in these more interesting and creative, in my opinion, stories
Dialogue: 2,2:50:49.92,2:50:52.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you find something that's a little bit different.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:52.91,2:50:58.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,Such as in {\i1}Mad Max{\i0}, the strange obsession and worship of gasoline and cars.
Dialogue: 2,2:50:58.79,2:51:01.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's something that's just really cool, and different.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:01.64,2:51:02.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I digress.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:02.90,2:51:08.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby pushes through this checkpoint and officially enters Scars' territory.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:08.24,2:51:11.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here we'll fight a ton of Scars,
Dialogue: 2,2:51:11.59,2:51:15.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,and believe me, you're going to be ploughing through them by the end of this sequence.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:23.09,2:51:26.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's actually a great many boss fight here that I really enjoyed
Dialogue: 2,2:51:26.06,2:51:29.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a woman that I can only assume is named Helga.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:29.12,2:51:32.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't actually know if her name is Helga by the way
Dialogue: 2,2:51:32.12,2:51:34.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just saying that because she looks like Helga.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:34.28,2:51:38.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless Abby bites off a part of her ear, which I thought was kind of funny.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:38.93,2:51:41.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,But eventually a bunch of her friends come over.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:41.00,2:51:43.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,They overpower Abby and knock her out,
Dialogue: 2,2:51:43.10,2:51:47.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,which then leads straight into a flashback to four months before.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:47.55,2:51:52.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,This would place this flashback right before the events of the prologue,
Dialogue: 2,2:51:52.43,2:51:55.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Abby and her whole group left for Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,2:51:55.55,2:52:00.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's Winter, Abby finds Owen in the aquarium with a bunch of pretty lights put up.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:00.32,2:52:01.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really relaxing,
Dialogue: 2,2:52:01.73,2:52:08.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it really is this calming contrast that's the name of the game for the second half of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0}.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:08.70,2:52:10.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something horrible will happen,
Dialogue: 2,2:52:10.52,2:52:13.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we'll see something pretty and relaxing,
Dialogue: 2,2:52:13.16,2:52:16.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then something, even more horrible will happen.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:16.19,2:52:19.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we cut back to a nice winter scene, and so on.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:19.68,2:52:24.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,In here there's actually many game where you can shoot some targets with a kitty bow and arrow.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:24.17,2:52:29.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's pretty damn stupid, but it gives the players something to do that isn't just talking.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:29.15,2:52:34.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Otherwise this entire flashback would simply be Abby, talking to Owen,
Dialogue: 2,2:52:34.04,2:52:37.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,walking up some stairs and then talking some more.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:37.04,2:52:42.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not to say that Naughty Dogs afraid of doing that in games or having a 10 minute cut scene,
Dialogue: 2,2:52:42.44,2:52:45.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it seems to me that if they can avoid it, they will,
Dialogue: 2,2:52:45.47,2:52:49.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they'll interspersed little mini game such as this to break up the monotony.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:49.48,2:52:53.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the point of the sequence, though, is to show that Abby found Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,2:52:53.45,2:52:57.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,or, at the very least has a lead that he's living in Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,2:52:57.56,2:53:02.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the point, of course, is that they hope that Tommy could help them find Joel.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:02.48,2:53:05.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, we know that Joel was living there too,
Dialogue: 2,2:53:05.24,2:53:08.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,But apparently, at this time Abby didn't know that.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:08.09,2:53:09.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not clear to me at least
Dialogue: 2,2:53:09.86,2:53:14.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,if Abby still thought they were looking only for Tommy in the opening sequence,
Dialogue: 2,2:53:14.81,2:53:18.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,or if by that time she thinks that Joel could be there too.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:18.02,2:53:22.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I mean some of the dialogue seems to imply that she's looking for Joel primarily,
Dialogue: 2,2:53:22.79,2:53:25.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that they only expected to find Tommy.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:25.25,2:53:28.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,But again, I just don't think it matters too much.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:28.01,2:53:32.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,The point is they're going to Jackson for Joel by way of Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,2:53:32.78,2:53:35.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if Joel happens to be there, great.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:35.03,2:53:41.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they mostly expect to find Tommy and hope to convince him to share Joel's location or whereabouts.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:41.42,2:53:45.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless after breaking to Owen that she has a lead on Joel's brother
Dialogue: 2,2:53:45.78,2:53:49.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby also throws out the fact that Isaac approved the whole squad,
Dialogue: 2,2:53:49.82,2:53:52.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,leaving for weeks on end to chase Joel down.
Dialogue: 2,2:53:52.88,2:53:56.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,She exclaims that Isaac is more about justice than any one,
Dialogue: 2,2:53:56.69,2:53:59.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why he apparently approves of the plan
Dialogue: 2,2:53:59.16,2:54:03.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,for them to leave for weeks and weeks on end, potentially months
Dialogue: 2,2:54:03.21,2:54:07.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,trying to hunt down a guy that did something terrible years and years ago.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:07.79,2:54:11.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,To me, it seems like a stretch that he would be willing to let this many people go,
Dialogue: 2,2:54:11.90,2:54:16.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially young whippersnappers, who were involved in the active patrolling
Dialogue: 2,2:54:16.12,2:54:19.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,and maintenance of the WLF's defenses.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:19.22,2:54:21.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless, maybe that's just me.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:21.84,2:54:28.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,And may be it actually is within Isaac's character to let them go but it seems like a stretch to me.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:28.22,2:54:31.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,After a brief debate back and forth, they settle on it.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:31.40,2:54:34.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're going to Jackson, they're going to try to find Tommy,
Dialogue: 2,2:54:34.70,2:54:38.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then they're going to try and find Joel, once and for all, and finish it.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:38.93,2:54:41.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we cut back to the forest.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:41.15,2:54:46.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually the trailer sequence that we saw back when we first met Abby years ago.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:46.64,2:54:49.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,I remember when I first saw this scene in the trailer,
Dialogue: 2,2:54:49.22,2:54:53.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,I thought that Abby was going to turn out to be Ellie's mom in this flashback,

Dialogue: 2,2:54:55.34,2:54:56.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,I was wrong.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:56.72,2:54:58.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like… really wrong.
Dialogue: 2,2:54:58.76,2:55:01.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Scars start to string up Abby for execution

Dialogue: 2,2:55:25.07,2:55:27.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,did something to piss off the Scars.

Dialogue: 2,2:55:34.61,2:55:35.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I have to say,
Dialogue: 2,2:55:35.78,2:55:40.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is probably the least clippy way they could have possibly clipped her wings.
Dialogue: 2,2:55:40.22,2:55:44.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other apostate shows up who will eventually find out his name Lev.

Dialogue: 2,2:56:43.74,2:56:45.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that you have to compliment them on.

Dialogue: 2,2:57:43.56,2:57:45.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Abby gets her stuff back
Dialogue: 2,2:57:45.16,2:57:50.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,because Helga just happened to be wearing Abby's backpack after capturing her earlier.
Dialogue: 2,2:57:50.33,2:57:52.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,I actually thought this was kind of a fun touch,
Dialogue: 2,2:57:52.34,2:57:56.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,since the normal way that you would find all of your gear after being kidnapped like this in a video game
Dialogue: 2,2:57:56.67,2:58:00.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be to just find it in a chest or sitting on a desk somewhere.
Dialogue: 2,2:58:00.35,2:58:03.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now there's some dialogue here about the Seraphites and the WLF

Dialogue: 2,2:58:10.19,2:58:12.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why it's a little more understandable.
Dialogue: 2,2:58:12.29,2:58:18.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby just saved Lev's life from Helga and Lev just saved Abby from hanging.
Dialogue: 2,2:58:18.65,2:58:23.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a clear tit for tat here, which is why I think this blood pact is formed.

Dialogue: 2,2:58:37.42,2:58:39.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Lev is being honest here,
Dialogue: 2,2:58:39.59,2:58:41.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's far more complicated than it seems.

Dialogue: 2,3:07:55.49,3:07:59.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure, you could say that they are former members of the group now
Dialogue: 2,3:07:59.88,3:08:03.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that they should be helped because they are apostate from the group.

Dialogue: 2,3:08:44.39,3:08:47.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this would likely lead to infection very quickly.

Dialogue: 2,3:09:34.42,3:09:36.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,but apparently never occurred to them that
Dialogue: 2,3:09:36.33,3:09:41.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,they might be using bridge systems above the city by using the rooftops.
Dialogue: 2,3:09:41.69,3:09:46.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,The point is that Lev offers to give them access to this bridge system.

Dialogue: 2,3:09:48.77,3:09:54.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,and says that they should be able to reach the hospital in around 2 hours if they were to follow the route.

Dialogue: 2,3:10:18.71,3:10:20.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's kind of refreshing to be honest.
Dialogue: 2,3:10:20.39,3:10:23.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Prior to this, it's very clear that Abby still has feelings for Owen.
Dialogue: 2,3:10:23.81,3:10:27.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even in the first chapter when we originally met Abby and Owen

Dialogue: 2,3:10:51.41,3:10:54.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not entirely sure if this was intentional or not,
Dialogue: 2,3:10:54.02,3:11:00.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the fact that there's zero chemistry between Owen and Mel seems pretty obvious to me.
Dialogue: 2,3:11:00.32,3:11:05.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if the writers are even somewhat competent, as I believe they are over at Naughty Dog,
Dialogue: 2,3:11:05.00,3:11:06.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,surely somebody noticed this.
Dialogue: 2,3:11:06.65,3:11:11.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,So either it was masterful performance on the part of the actors and the writers to make sure that

Dialogue: 2,3:11:25.94,3:11:28.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it was the result of a misfire and the writing.
Dialogue: 2,3:11:28.22,3:11:30.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's the former personally.
Dialogue: 2,3:11:30.11,3:11:34.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that Mel and Owen are supposed to come off as a little strange.

Dialogue: 2,3:11:42.56,3:11:44.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they're confused as to why they are not just together.
Dialogue: 2,3:11:44.90,3:11:49.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that tension will eventually be resolved, just… just wait.

Dialogue: 2,3:12:07.61,3:12:13.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it doesn't answer the question as to how the WLF weren't aware of this bridge system.
Dialogue: 2,3:12:13.11,3:12:17.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because chances are, it's not always cloudy and foggy

Dialogue: 2,3:12:43.79,3:12:47.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,they climbed through multiple buildings, explore some different areas,
Dialogue: 2,3:12:47.51,3:12:50.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they share in a few interesting conversations.
Dialogue: 2,3:12:50.57,3:12:53.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now there's nothing really crazy here, it's mostly awkward small talk,
Dialogue: 2,3:12:53.87,3:12:57.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it mostly serves to show that they are growing more comfortable with each other.
Dialogue: 2,3:12:57.92,3:13:01.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,My personal favorite moment is when they come across somebody's apartment,
Dialogue: 2,3:13:01.13,3:13:03.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,who was clearly very into gaming.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:03.95,3:13:06.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, they even still have their D&D game set up
Dialogue: 2,3:13:06.60,3:13:09.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they have their Playstation gear scattered throughout the apartment.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:09.95,3:13:11.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's kind of cool.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:11.09,3:13:14.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,And personally, I would like to think that this whole apartment is modeled
Dialogue: 2,3:13:14.57,3:13:16.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,after one of the developers apartments.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:16.55,3:13:21.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,I've heard stories of developers from Bethesda and Rocksteady doing this type of thing
Dialogue: 2,3:13:21.76,3:13:25.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,where they take an environment model it after their own personal environment
Dialogue: 2,3:13:25.40,3:13:27.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,because after all, that's what they know.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:27.20,3:13:30.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a little piece of the real world in this imaginary world,
Dialogue: 2,3:13:30.83,3:13:33.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I just think that it's super cool.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:33.02,3:13:38.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I thought that this particular building was especially detailed.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:38.15,3:13:40.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,The two travel through a plethora of buildings,
Dialogue: 2,3:13:40.64,3:13:42.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,they push through some rapids,
Dialogue: 2,3:13:42.65,3:13:46.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they eventually land on a construction site that's next to the target building.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:46.70,3:13:48.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it just so happens that in this construction site
Dialogue: 2,3:13:48.87,3:13:52.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,is one of the most interesting combat arenas of the entire game.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:52.64,3:13:57.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's a ton of verticality here and there's a lot of Seraphites scattered throughout.
Dialogue: 2,3:13:57.40,3:14:00.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Some of them are Brutes, some of them have short range weapons,
Dialogue: 2,3:14:00.53,3:14:02.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,and some of them have long range weapons.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:02.87,3:14:06.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really interesting how they laid all of this out and on harder difficulties.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:06.32,3:14:09.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me just tell you it kicked my ass a few times.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:09.47,3:14:11.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's important to say that it felt fair.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:11.96,3:14:17.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,It wasn't as though I was getting my ass handed to me, and I felt like I was being slighted
Dialogue: 2,3:14:17.16,3:14:21.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,like a poorly designed boss that's able to clip through walls or something.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:21.29,3:14:23.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,This level feels completely fair.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:23.18,3:14:28.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,It just seems like a difficult situation where Lev and Abby have to work perfectly in tandem.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:28.22,3:14:30.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when that happens, things work out.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:30.47,3:14:32.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,But after clearing this area,
Dialogue: 2,3:14:32.45,3:14:37.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,the two get into an industrial elevator that they can take all the way to the top to reach the bridge.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:37.85,3:14:41.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if you remember from earlier Abby's worst nightmare is heights.
Dialogue: 2,3:14:41.83,3:14:46.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here, Lev actually shares a bit of sweet advice to try and take out his mind off of the terror
Dialogue: 2,3:14:46.86,3:14:50.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,that she feels due to the enormous and ever increasing heights.
Dialogue: 2,3:15:29.09,3:15:32.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, at the top of the skyscraper, they begin crossing the bridge,
Dialogue: 2,3:15:32.18,3:15:35.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is actually just a partially collapsed crane.
Dialogue: 2,3:15:35.60,3:15:41.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,This again reaffirms the point that the WLF probably should have seen this crane on a clear day
Dialogue: 2,3:15:41.67,3:15:44.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,and been intrigued enough to go and investigate it.
Dialogue: 2,3:15:44.15,3:15:46.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe even claiming it for themselves.
Dialogue: 2,3:15:46.10,3:15:50.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe there's a line or something that mentions why the WLF haven't used this bridge,
Dialogue: 2,3:15:50.69,3:15:55.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I just missed it or I couldn't think of it or remember it when writing the script.
Dialogue: 2,3:15:55.58,3:15:58.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,But either way, if there is something, let me know.
Dialogue: 2,3:15:58.19,3:16:03.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, understandably, Abby starts crossing the bridge and begins to completely freak out.
Dialogue: 2,3:16:03.44,3:16:07.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,To be honest, any normal person would probably be freaking out at this point,
Dialogue: 2,3:16:07.73,3:16:10.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't think it's just people who are afraid of heights.
Dialogue: 2,3:16:10.10,3:16:14.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the fact that Abby is completely and utterly petrified by heights,
Dialogue: 2,3:16:14.15,3:16:17.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think just proves the point that this is not a good time for her.
Dialogue: 2,3:16:17.78,3:16:20.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's actually while crossing this makeshift bridge,
Dialogue: 2,3:16:20.63,3:16:24.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Lev throws out one of the funniest lines of the entire game,
Dialogue: 2,3:16:24.65,3:16:28.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least as far as I'm concerned, because it comes out of absolutely nowhere.
Dialogue: 2,3:16:36.99,3:16:38.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hah… I love it!
Dialogue: 2,3:16:38.41,3:16:40.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now after crossing the first bridge,
Dialogue: 2,3:16:40.00,3:16:43.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,it seems as though they've finished and gotten through the hardest part.
Dialogue: 2,3:16:43.12,3:16:44.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,But… NO.
Dialogue: 2,3:16:52.57,3:16:54.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this is one of the few times I really remember
Dialogue: 2,3:16:54.68,3:16:58.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,being completely blown away by a set piece in this game.
Dialogue: 2,3:16:58.36,3:17:03.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,The bridge is beautiful and yet creepy at the same time.
Dialogue: 2,3:17:03.34,3:17:06.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the hospital in the distance is also all inspiring,
Dialogue: 2,3:17:06.40,3:17:11.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,and serves its purpose very well in informing the player of where they are within Seattle.
Dialogue: 2,3:17:11.29,3:17:13.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will say, though it was a little disappointing
Dialogue: 2,3:17:13.40,3:17:17.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,because there was some artifacting in Z-fighting on the textures when I first played,
Dialogue: 2,3:17:17.20,3:17:19.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I can get over it.
Dialogue: 2,3:17:19.09,3:17:22.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's pretty rare to see a graphical glitch like this in a Naughty Dog games
Dialogue: 2,3:17:22.54,3:17:23.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I'm letting it slide.
Dialogue: 2,3:17:23.89,3:17:26.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,But just like that, Abby crosses the bridge.
Dialogue: 2,3:17:26.96,3:17:29.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's conquered her fears with the Lev's help.
Dialogue: 2,3:17:29.76,3:17:33.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's achieved that which she thought was unachievable
Dialogue: 2,3:17:33.94,3:17:36.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,that she could cross this grand expanse…
Dialogue: 2,3:17:36.43,3:17:37.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,… Oh, my God! She fell!
Dialogue: 2,3:18:02.62,3:18:04.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, yeah, she… she falls.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:04.74,3:18:06.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good thing there is a penthouse pool right?
Dialogue: 2,3:18:06.42,3:18:08.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the new dynamic duo decides
Dialogue: 2,3:18:08.48,3:18:11.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,to work their way to the bottom of the tower now that they've crossed
Dialogue: 2,3:18:11.52,3:18:15.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once at the base, they are going to be able to head straight for the hospital.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:15.78,3:18:20.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,Throughout the descent, there's a few hordes that you fight through of infected.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:20.59,3:18:26.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby also finds a flame thrower, which is probably the best hoard weapon in the entire game.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:26.20,3:18:27.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it has such a widespread.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:27.97,3:18:31.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,It makes it really easy to handle crowds and large numbers of infected.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:31.90,3:18:34.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I will say that ammo is so limited.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:34.09,3:18:39.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,It makes it really hard to use it in any sort of consistent way.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:39.04,3:18:41.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll also say that this tower actually excited me.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:41.92,3:18:44.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,I thought there would be some really cool opportunities for
Dialogue: 2,3:18:44.75,3:18:48.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,different combat sequences with a lot of verticality.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:48.10,3:18:53.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,And maybe some platforming with the rope mechanic… some thing,
Dialogue: 2,3:18:53.38,3:18:55.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,but really there's not much here.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:55.30,3:18:58.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,You just kind of make your way to the bottom of the tower, and that's it.
Dialogue: 2,3:18:58.30,3:19:03.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,After fighting through a few rooms of infected, seems like a missed opportunity.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:03.25,3:19:06.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless, they get to the bottom, and they come out right by the hospital.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:06.94,3:19:11.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is actually the same exact area that Ellie entered the hospital earlier
Dialogue: 2,3:19:11.18,3:19:14.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,or in continuity I guess after this.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:14.44,3:19:20.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then this is probably a good time to bring up the fact that there are a lot of reused areas in the game.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:20.05,3:19:22.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,This has been something that a lot of people have criticized.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:22.42,3:19:27.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,That Naughty Dog seems to just be recycling the same maps and levels with different characters,
Dialogue: 2,3:19:27.46,3:19:30.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,or in this case just between Abby and Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:30.61,3:19:35.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I don't think it's actually fair to criticize them purely because they reuse levels.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:35.26,3:19:39.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,A level in a video game at least seems to be, in my estimation,
Dialogue: 2,3:19:39.97,3:19:43.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,a collection of different items, a lay out of a map,
Dialogue: 2,3:19:43.08,3:19:46.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,and in general, a pool of possibilities.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:46.33,3:19:51.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,Different things that the player can do to interact with that level to achieve a set goal.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:51.43,3:19:54.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,A really simple level would just be a room with a door.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:54.52,3:19:59.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,You walked to the door, open it and leave, you've completed the level.
Dialogue: 2,3:19:59.08,3:20:04.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, a complicated level would be one in which you have a complicated goal,
Dialogue: 2,3:20:04.06,3:20:07.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,such as making it out of this area alive.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:07.53,3:20:11.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the developer complicates the achieving of that goal
Dialogue: 2,3:20:11.17,3:20:16.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,by introducing many different enemies that you could fight complicated traversal,
Dialogue: 2,3:20:16.33,3:20:20.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,or maybe even a puzzle that you have to solve in order to get through the door.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:20.29,3:20:23.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is how you take a level from something as simple as walking through a door
Dialogue: 2,3:20:23.94,3:20:26.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,into something more complicated and engaging for the player.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:26.83,3:20:27.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,For this reason,
Dialogue: 2,3:20:27.55,3:20:32.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't think it's completely fair to say that Naughty Dog is purely reusing levels here.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:32.65,3:20:38.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because Abby and Ellie interact with these levels in completely different ways.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:38.71,3:20:42.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,When Abby's walking through the hospital here and eventually finds Nora,
Dialogue: 2,3:20:42.52,3:20:45.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,she's not actually fighting these people.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:45.64,3:20:47.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's not shooting them,
Dialogue: 2,3:20:47.08,3:20:50.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,she's not throwing bombs and molotovs on them.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:50.20,3:20:52.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's just walking and talking,
Dialogue: 2,3:20:52.42,3:20:56.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,not to mention that you also go to areas of the hospital that were unseen by Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,3:20:56.62,3:20:59.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when you compare this to Ellie traverse this level,
Dialogue: 2,3:20:59.35,3:21:01.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,well, it's pretty different.
Dialogue: 2,3:21:01.25,3:21:05.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if your point is that they are clearly taking short cuts in terms of development
Dialogue: 2,3:21:05.95,3:21:10.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,by putting these characters in the same levels and structuring the story in that way,
Dialogue: 2,3:21:10.84,3:21:14.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think you can make that point, and perhaps that's fair.
Dialogue: 2,3:21:14.89,3:21:20.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't see the inherent problem with reusing a level if it makes sense in the story
Dialogue: 2,3:21:20.64,3:21:24.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,or if you write the story in a way where that makes sense
Dialogue: 2,3:21:24.54,3:21:29.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,because a quality game can be set in something as small as a couple of hallways.
Dialogue: 2,3:21:29.86,3:21:33.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,Look at something like P.T., which was technically just a playable teaser,
Dialogue: 2,3:21:33.70,3:21:36.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,but even that was considered to be wildly successful,
Dialogue: 2,3:21:36.85,3:21:43.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it only really took place in two hallways, a back room and a bathroom I suppose.
Dialogue: 2,3:21:43.65,3:21:47.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's really all there was to it, and yet it was phenomenal.
Dialogue: 2,3:21:47.17,3:21:49.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can knit pick something as simple as
Dialogue: 2,3:21:49.41,3:21:53.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,how many times a particular mesh is used throughout a game,
Dialogue: 2,3:21:53.11,3:21:57.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you can argue your point based on how the game uses that asset.
Dialogue: 2,3:21:57.76,3:22:01.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think the latter is much more reasonable and much more defensible.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:01.78,3:22:03.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I digress.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:03.19,3:22:06.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby heads into the hospital alone, leaving Lev behind
Dialogue: 2,3:22:06.41,3:22:12.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,because quite obviously, if Lev were seen anywhere near the hospital, we wouldn't survive for very long.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:12.55,3:22:15.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby plays it cool with all of the WLF members.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:15.43,3:22:20.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's only a matter of time before everybody finds out that Abby's disobeyed Isaac's orders.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:20.29,3:22:23.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think Abby knows this, which is why she's moving through the level pretty quickly,
Dialogue: 2,3:22:23.74,3:22:26.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,trying to find the materials that she needs and leave.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:26.62,3:22:30.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean not to mention also that the girl that she's getting the materials for
Dialogue: 2,3:22:30.56,3:22:33.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,is on death's door that probably motivates her,
Dialogue: 2,3:22:33.64,3:22:37.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,her rushing a little bit, but by who am I to say.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:37.01,3:22:40.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,You walk through here, talking a few people and… oh look!
Dialogue: 2,3:22:40.63,3:22:45.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the Vita girl that Ellie stabbed and crap out of earlier,
Dialogue: 2,3:22:45.03,3:22:50.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,or I guess later, because he or she is still alive, that's… that's funny.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:50.24,3:22:53.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Abby doesn't make it far into the hospital though.
Dialogue: 2,3:22:53.06,3:22:55.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's arrested once they check in with Isaac
Dialogue: 2,3:22:55.33,3:22:58.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,and find out that she has actually been AWOL since the day before,
Dialogue: 2,3:22:58.57,3:23:01.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,so she's locked up in the elevator.
Dialogue: 2,3:23:01.21,3:23:06.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's basically gonna held until they transport everything back to the front base with Isaac,

Dialogue: 2,3:23:28.09,3:23:33.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,Isaac mentioned earlier that he's planning on doing one final push into the Seraphites' island

Dialogue: 2,3:23:36.34,3:23:39.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a pretty big deal because without a doubt,
Dialogue: 2,3:23:39.01,3:23:43.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,many hundreds or even thousands of people are about to die.
Dialogue: 2,3:23:43.27,3:23:46.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could have seen an alternative timeline or storyline

Dialogue: 2,3:24:00.34,3:24:04.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I understand that this is probably a little more relatable,
Dialogue: 2,3:24:04.27,3:24:08.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially because when you can emotionally attached the player to one character,
Dialogue: 2,3:24:08.86,3:24:12.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this case, Yara, and in another instance Lev.
Dialogue: 2,3:24:12.70,3:24:16.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can do a lot more compared to if you are trying to make the player

Dialogue: 2,3:24:36.10,3:24:40.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's because they think that Nora let Abby go, because well, she did.
Dialogue: 2,3:24:40.37,3:24:42.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again I think it's really cool to get a fresh understanding of

Dialogue: 2,3:25:15.28,3:25:20.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,They weren't just moving materials from one location to the other to be convenient for the game story.
Dialogue: 2,3:25:20.80,3:25:24.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,But rather there is an overarching theme and idea behind it,

Dialogue: 2,3:25:28.00,3:25:33.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,and really would never have been brought up if Ellie's story is where the game ended.

Dialogue: 2,3:25:49.93,3:25:54.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,And she knows also that all of the other materials in the rest of the hospital have been picked clean

Dialogue: 2,3:25:58.33,3:26:02.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so the only place that's left for Abby to collect these items would be the basement.
Dialogue: 2,3:26:02.89,3:26:09.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,Problem being, when the outbreak initially happened in 2013, on outbreak day,
Dialogue: 2,3:26:09.79,3:26:12.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,everybody was brought to the hospital.
Dialogue: 2,3:26:12.08,3:26:17.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,With this obviously, there was a massive outbreak within the hospital itself
Dialogue: 2,3:26:17.22,3:26:20.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and eventually everything was quarantined off.
Dialogue: 2,3:26:20.02,3:26:25.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,The doors were locked and the stairs destroyed such that the infected couldn't reach the upper levels
Dialogue: 2,3:26:25.75,3:26:28.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,and would be trapped in the basement indefinitely.
Dialogue: 2,3:26:28.75,3:26:30.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if you played the original {\i1}TLOU{\i0},

Dialogue: 2,3:26:39.49,3:26:44.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,This means that all of the zombies and infected that you're going to see in the basement

Dialogue: 2,3:26:47.86,3:26:54.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,That makes them some of the most dangerous and severe infected in this entire city.
Dialogue: 2,3:26:54.25,3:26:58.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I don't know about you guys, but the second that I figured this out,
Dialogue: 2,3:26:58.09,3:27:00.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,I knew that we are probably going to end up finding
Dialogue: 2,3:27:00.46,3:27:04.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,a new type of infected or at the very least a new boss.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:04.21,3:27:06.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I was damn ready for that.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:06.16,3:27:09.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,The infected in {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} seemed to be a bit of an afterthought.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:09.64,3:27:14.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's not a whole lot of focus on them, and I get it, there's a lot more going on.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:14.11,3:27:19.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I kind of miss how central the zombies were in the original game.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:19.21,3:27:24.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the idea of having a brand new type of infected introduce that we have to go up against
Dialogue: 2,3:27:24.22,3:27:27.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,was pretty interesting and I was damn ready for it.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:27.13,3:27:29.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so Nora leads Abby to the basement

Dialogue: 2,3:27:32.18,3:27:34.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's at this point that she leaves Abby to it,
Dialogue: 2,3:27:34.84,3:27:39.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and of course, as we know, she heads back upstairs to be confronted by Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:39.49,3:27:45.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it's at this point that Abby enters with Naughty Dog labeled this level as which is Ground Zero.

Dialogue: 2,3:27:50.23,3:27:54.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even Abby knows that there's probably going to be something pretty serious in here.
Dialogue: 2,3:27:54.22,3:27:56.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's only verified and reaffirmed
Dialogue: 2,3:27:56.72,3:28:00.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,by the fact that she starts seeing and hearing strange things almost immediately.
Dialogue: 2,3:28:00.70,3:28:04.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Abby pushes on and explores the area, trying to find the stuff that she needs,
Dialogue: 2,3:28:04.81,3:28:09.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and eventually she reconnects the power and pushes through some locked doors,
Dialogue: 2,3:28:09.10,3:28:10.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,only to find…
Dialogue: 2,3:28:17.59,3:28:20.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, the door has been ripped open.
Dialogue: 2,3:28:20.26,3:28:22.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's something really big here, and Abby knows it.
Dialogue: 2,3:28:22.87,3:28:24.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, there is nowhere else to go.
Dialogue: 2,3:28:24.49,3:28:29.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Abby pushes through the tunnel and eventually finds the tools that she needs in an ambulance.
Dialogue: 2,3:28:29.68,3:28:34.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,But of course, because timing is perfect in every horror situation,
Dialogue: 2,3:28:34.51,3:28:35.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,this guy comes along.

Dialogue: 2,3:29:03.22,3:29:07.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a coagulation of multiple infected and Clickers,
Dialogue: 2,3:29:07.33,3:29:10.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's pretty disgusting looking,
Dialogue: 2,3:29:10.57,3:29:15.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I actually think that it's pretty impressive all things considered.
Dialogue: 2,3:29:15.04,3:29:17.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something I did not see coming to be honest.
Dialogue: 2,3:29:17.53,3:29:21.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I'm sorry to report that this disgusting creature
Dialogue: 2,3:29:21.08,3:29:24.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,is not actually that difficult all things considered.
Dialogue: 2,3:29:24.07,3:29:27.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,He moved so slowly that he can't be considered a major difficulty
Dialogue: 2,3:29:27.54,3:29:29.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,unless you're on, for instance, grounded.
Dialogue: 2,3:29:29.89,3:29:33.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,He moves so slowly that I wouldn't even really consider him much of a threat.
Dialogue: 2,3:29:33.82,3:29:36.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,He is a bullet sponge to be completely honest,
Dialogue: 2,3:29:36.67,3:29:39.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,but if you have enough ammo, you're just going to run around the building,

Dialogue: 2,3:29:41.44,3:29:46.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially since they have dynamically generated crafting materials scattered throughout this floor.
Dialogue: 2,3:29:46.75,3:29:50.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,This means that you can always collect items, run to a corner, craft,

Dialogue: 2,3:29:52.12,3:29:55.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then throw pipe bombs and molotovs item if you need to.
Dialogue: 2,3:29:55.57,3:29:56.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think more broadly,
Dialogue: 2,3:29:56.68,3:30:01.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,difficulty in this game tends to come from the quantity of enemies.
Dialogue: 2,3:30:01.30,3:30:04.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And ah…  Motherfu…
Dialogue: 2,3:30:10.00,3:30:12.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, it's real nasty.
Dialogue: 2,3:30:12.13,3:30:17.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you unload absolutely everything that you have into these two until they are eventually killed.
Dialogue: 2,3:30:17.77,3:30:22.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so Abby heads back up to the surface with all of the gear that she came for,

Dialogue: 2,3:31:57.58,3:31:59.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,it seemed as though that was implying that

Dialogue: 2,3:32:27.10,3:32:31.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe it's just because they saved her life when they didn't need to.

Dialogue: 2,3:33:18.67,3:33:23.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,And basically she just wants Abby to leave her Owen and the new kids alone.
Dialogue: 2,3:33:23.29,3:33:27.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,She says that if Abby sticks along for any longer than she's going to screw everything up.
Dialogue: 2,3:33:27.66,3:33:33.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,So she might as well leave them to go to Santa Barbara by themselves and remain here with the WLF.
Dialogue: 2,3:33:33.37,3:33:38.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean the drama kind of makes sense, considering that Abby just slept with Mel's baby daddy.
Dialogue: 2,3:33:38.52,3:33:42.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I don't know if she knows this, or if she know and talked about it.
Dialogue: 2,3:33:42.22,3:33:47.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,But either way, it upsets Abby pretty significantly, and Abby actually starts to cry,
Dialogue: 2,3:33:47.38,3:33:51.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of the first times we see a crack in this facade that she puts forward,
Dialogue: 2,3:33:51.49,3:33:52.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I think this hits hard for Abby,
Dialogue: 2,3:33:52.93,3:33:56.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,because she probably knows that it's true, at least to some extent.
Dialogue: 2,3:33:56.46,3:33:59.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean she is kind of toxic,
Dialogue: 2,3:33:59.04,3:34:03.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,she literally dragged a group of her closest friends halfway across the country,
Dialogue: 2,3:34:03.10,3:34:04.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,just to murder a dude.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:04.36,3:34:08.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,Meanwhile, Yara is dealing with Lev, who's come to the naive conclusion
Dialogue: 2,3:34:08.40,3:34:12.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,that he can convince their mother to join them in abandoning the cult.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:12.45,3:34:17.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yara, of course, realizes that this is a naive and stupid estimation
Dialogue: 2,3:34:17.30,3:34:18.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,of what they could do with their mother.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:18.70,3:34:22.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless Lev is convinced that there is a way.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:22.12,3:34:27.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Abby and Yara look for a gift that they can give to Lev, to make him feel better and stay.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:27.64,3:34:31.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it's during this chapter that the elephant in the room comes out,
Dialogue: 2,3:34:31.69,3:34:34.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's something that I'm sure many of us saw coming,
Dialogue: 2,3:34:34.12,3:34:38.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially if you've been listening to the passive dialogue for the last few hours of gameplay.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:38.86,3:34:41.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, Lev is trans.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:41.16,3:34:44.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,In some of the previous combat sequences when you're moving with Lev through,
Dialogue: 2,3:34:44.38,3:34:48.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,for instance, the construction site in fighting a lot of Seraphites,
Dialogue: 2,3:34:48.10,3:34:53.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's times when the Seraphites will actually call out to Lev, referring to him as Lily.
Dialogue: 2,3:34:53.86,3:34:57.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if you've been kind of mentally checked out for the majority of the game,
Dialogue: 2,3:34:57.04,3:35:00.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,this might come as a total shock, or it might just be confusing
Dialogue: 2,3:35:00.34,3:35:04.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,as to why they're referring to this character as Lily and not Lev.
Dialogue: 2,3:35:04.18,3:35:08.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's for that very reason that Yara and Lev left the group.
Dialogue: 2,3:35:08.74,3:35:11.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,Lev was to be married off to one of the elders.
Dialogue: 2,3:35:11.17,3:35:15.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,Naturally, Lev did not agree with this or like the idea,
Dialogue: 2,3:35:15.16,3:35:18.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so started acting out eventually, cutting his hair,
Dialogue: 2,3:35:18.16,3:35:23.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,and fully transitioning, wanting to be referred to entreated as a male Seraphite,
Dialogue: 2,3:35:23.50,3:35:27.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,going out on patrols being trained and used as a soldier.
Dialogue: 2,3:35:27.49,3:35:30.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in what comes as absolutely no surprise to anybody,
Dialogue: 2,3:35:30.25,3:35:34.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Seraphites weren't exactly the most supportive of this transition.
Dialogue: 2,3:35:34.09,3:35:38.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they decided that they were going to severely punish Lev,
Dialogue: 2,3:35:38.32,3:35:43.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,or at the very least, we're not going to allow this alternative lifestyle, shall we say.
Dialogue: 2,3:35:43.93,3:35:50.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so Yara being a supportive and strong sister decided to come out with Lev and help them escape.
Dialogue: 2,3:35:50.95,3:35:55.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is, of course, why they're constantly referred to as apostate by the Seraphites,
Dialogue: 2,3:35:55.90,3:35:59.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,and why so many of the Seraphites in combat sequences
Dialogue: 2,3:35:59.11,3:36:03.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,will call out and ask Yara and Lev why they're doing what they're doing.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:03.37,3:36:07.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because as far as they knew up until very recently, they were just fine.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:07.51,3:36:10.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now there's been a lot of hubbub about this plot point.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:10.36,3:36:11.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,There has been a lot of debate,
Dialogue: 2,3:36:11.56,3:36:15.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,both left and right of center as to whether or not this was handled well.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:15.64,3:36:16.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to be honest,
Dialogue: 2,3:36:16.90,3:36:20.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not really qualified to come to a determination on that point.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:20.47,3:36:23.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,But to me it seemed to be handled relatively well.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:23.65,3:36:26.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Though in this particular scene in the aquarium
Dialogue: 2,3:36:26.20,3:36:29.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Yara and Abby are talking about it,
Dialogue: 2,3:36:29.17,3:36:30.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,it does seem a little heavy handed.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:30.98,3:36:34.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I first figured it out for sure was a few hours before this,
Dialogue: 2,3:36:34.66,3:36:40.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Lev and Abby were exploring the tower together and Lev actually asks Abby,
Dialogue: 2,3:36:40.27,3:36:43.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether or not she heard what the other Seraphites were calling him.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:43.63,3:36:45.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,This, of course, was referencing the fact
Dialogue: 2,3:36:45.55,3:36:50.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the Seraphites constantly referred to Lev as Lily, or as the apostate.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:50.50,3:36:54.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby said she was aware of this, but that she didn't need to talk about it.
Dialogue: 2,3:36:54.22,3:36:57.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,That I thought was a pretty discreet way of handling something
Dialogue: 2,3:36:57.22,3:37:00.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Lev probably isn't too excited to talk about,
Dialogue: 2,3:37:00.22,3:37:04.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that frankly, isn't that important to what their end goal is.
Dialogue: 2,3:37:04.66,3:37:07.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is one of the things that I've liked about Naughty Dog's work in the past
Dialogue: 2,3:37:07.95,3:37:12.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,when they have more diverse cast members or characters within their stories,
Dialogue: 2,3:37:12.91,3:37:16.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's usually not the defining point of that character.
Dialogue: 2,3:37:16.30,3:37:19.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,If there's a gay character in the original {\i1}TLOU{\i0},
Dialogue: 2,3:37:19.03,3:37:24.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's there for you to see and you can put it together if you're paying any attention whatsoever.
Dialogue: 2,3:37:24.01,3:37:27.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's not the defining point of that character.
Dialogue: 2,3:37:27.82,3:37:31.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,When somebody is purely defined by one trait of themselves,
Dialogue: 2,3:37:31.90,3:37:36.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether that something like sexual identity or their religion or their appearance,
Dialogue: 2,3:37:36.82,3:37:41.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's always a bad thing because people are far more complicated than that,
Dialogue: 2,3:37:41.77,3:37:45.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you shouldn't boil yourself down to just one trait.
Dialogue: 2,3:37:45.16,3:37:47.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're far more interesting than that.
Dialogue: 2,3:37:47.29,3:37:51.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is why generally, I feel that Naughty Dog's approach to these types of things is good
Dialogue: 2,3:37:51.49,3:37:54.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they don't make it the defining characteristic.
Dialogue: 2,3:37:54.40,3:38:01.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, in this most recent gained {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} and in their previous title, {\i1}Uncharted: The Lost Legacy{\i0},
Dialogue: 2,3:38:01.72,3:38:05.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,they fall prey much more to these heavy handed traits
Dialogue: 2,3:38:05.17,3:38:10.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,where they make a character define themselves purely by an external trait.
Dialogue: 2,3:38:10.63,3:38:15.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,And while I have no problem with whatever that trait may be by itself,
Dialogue: 2,3:38:15.70,3:38:18.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that defining a character that you are crafting
Dialogue: 2,3:38:18.75,3:38:21.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,and putting it into a story by just that one trait
Dialogue: 2,3:38:21.40,3:38:23.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,is lazy writing.
Dialogue: 2,3:38:23.04,3:38:27.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think it does a disservice to the people who actually share that trait in reality.
Dialogue: 2,3:38:27.91,3:38:32.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, I think it's handled relatively well, if not a little heavy handed.
Dialogue: 2,3:38:32.29,3:38:35.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it doesn't seem to be that crucial of a reveal,
Dialogue: 2,3:38:35.95,3:38:39.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,and as far as I can tell, most people don't particularly care.
Dialogue: 2,3:38:39.70,3:38:41.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,I also can't help recognized
Dialogue: 2,3:38:41.48,3:38:46.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Naughty Dog saved this reveal quote-unquote for much later in the game.
Dialogue: 2,3:38:46.00,3:38:49.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Chances are, if you've made it this far, you're going to be much more understanding
Dialogue: 2,3:38:49.81,3:38:52.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,whereas if they put this reveal much earlier on in the game,
Dialogue: 2,3:38:52.87,3:38:55.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,it would be troll fodder without a doubt.
Dialogue: 2,3:38:55.68,3:38:57.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe that's smart, maybe it's cowardly,
Dialogue: 2,3:38:57.67,3:39:00.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,maybe it's just a coincidence that its revealed later in the game.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:00.79,3:39:04.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not sure, either way, I don't particularly care,
Dialogue: 2,3:39:04.45,3:39:05.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I don't think it matters.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:05.80,3:39:08.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, after they find a nice gift for Lev,
Dialogue: 2,3:39:08.83,3:39:14.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,they eventually push out to the edge of the aquarium and realized that Lev's taken a boat
Dialogue: 2,3:39:14.48,3:39:18.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,and is headed straight for the island that the Scars are based out of.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:18.00,3:39:20.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,Lev's going to try to save his mom,
Dialogue: 2,3:39:20.02,3:39:23.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it really is…  it's just stupid to do this.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:23.77,3:39:26.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,This was one moment where I was a little confused,
Dialogue: 2,3:39:26.26,3:39:29.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,just because Lev doesn't seem like a naive or stupid person.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:29.89,3:39:34.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, Lev's young, but that isn't necessarily directly correlative.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:34.44,3:39:37.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can be young and wise beyond your years.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:37.30,3:39:40.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,Look at Ellie, for instance, in the first game she was young,
Dialogue: 2,3:39:40.60,3:39:42.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,but she was not naive whatsoever.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:42.70,3:39:46.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,I do not think that Ellie would have made this same rash decision.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:46.60,3:39:49.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the very least, you would have taken some time to plan out some way
Dialogue: 2,3:39:49.92,3:39:55.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,of dealing with this potential problem of leaving her mother forever potentially.
Dialogue: 2,3:39:55.84,3:40:00.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, because Naughty Dog needs a reason to show the player that Seraphites' island
Dialogue: 2,3:40:00.96,3:40:05.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this huge raid that the WLF are going to be carrying out on the island.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:05.05,3:40:09.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,They just put this together and say, "well, we'll have Lev race to the island".
Dialogue: 2,3:40:09.55,3:40:13.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you follow Lev and you'll get to see all of this crazy stuff.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:13.45,3:40:17.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that this one is again a little bit of a coincidence and
Dialogue: 2,3:40:17.68,3:40:23.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,seems to reek a little bit of the writer's trying to force characters into a situation
Dialogue: 2,3:40:23.21,3:40:28.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,that hasn't naturally percolated through the circumstances of what's going on.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:28.06,3:40:30.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's why this timing here is so important.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:30.46,3:40:34.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's because Abby's group is going to try to leave Seattle before the storm picks up.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:34.81,3:40:41.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,That storm is going to be used as cover for Isaac's final push on to the Seraphites' Island,
Dialogue: 2,3:40:41.02,3:40:45.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Isaac is not going to be delaying this push whatsoever at all.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:45.46,3:40:48.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,He's done with fighting as he told us earlier in the game.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:48.97,3:40:52.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's why all of this gear has been moved to the front base.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:52.09,3:40:55.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's because they're going to have one last, wipe-out fight
Dialogue: 2,3:40:55.09,3:40:58.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,to finish the Scars for good and be done with them.
Dialogue: 2,3:40:58.18,3:41:03.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at the same time, Abby can use this storm as cover to make her escape to Santa Barbara.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:03.97,3:41:06.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, this is much more of a lesser point.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:06.00,3:41:10.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because realistically, Abby and Owen, Mel, Yara and Lev
Dialogue: 2,3:41:10.53,3:41:13.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,don't really need that much cover to escape.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:13.21,3:41:15.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,If they have a boat, they can just leave.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:15.67,3:41:21.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,The WLF as far as I've seen in this game, don't actively patrolled the water.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:21.04,3:41:22.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,They do have boats that they use,
Dialogue: 2,3:41:22.57,3:41:27.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is after all, where Abby and Yara are going to grab a boat here in just a minute,
Dialogue: 2,3:41:27.85,3:41:30.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they don't seem to patrol it actively.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:30.31,3:41:32.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know, if they do patrol it actively,
Dialogue: 2,3:41:32.29,3:41:36.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that's why all of these people need the storm to cover their tracks.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:36.46,3:41:41.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,That would be interesting, but I'm not aware of any time when that's directly referenced.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:41.44,3:41:43.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you know, please let me know in the comments section below.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:43.84,3:41:48.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so Abby and Yara naturally decide that they need to go and get Lev,
Dialogue: 2,3:41:48.07,3:41:50.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,because if Lev steps foot on the island,
Dialogue: 2,3:41:50.53,3:41:54.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,chances are he will be killed within the first twenty seconds
Dialogue: 2,3:41:54.64,3:41:57.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,of being witnessed by any of the other Seraphites.
Dialogue: 2,3:41:57.40,3:42:00.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so Abby in Yara start to push for the marina.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:00.34,3:42:06.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,They eventually hear some sniper shots and Yara determines that she needs to stay behind.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:06.10,3:42:08.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,She, after all, only has one arm at this time,
Dialogue: 2,3:42:08.53,3:42:12.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it's a little harder for her to navigate these complex passageways
Dialogue: 2,3:42:12.80,3:42:16.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,of latter stairs and rafters that she has to jump across.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:16.03,3:42:19.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,You eventually cross into a wide open inner state
Dialogue: 2,3:42:19.37,3:42:24.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,and are instantly tackled right as you pop out by… who else but Manny.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:24.76,3:42:26.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is where the sniper is.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:26.26,3:42:30.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,He's got to pin down and has apparently killed all of Manny's guys.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:30.19,3:42:34.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so Abby and Manny worked together to push up and take out this sniper.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:34.39,3:42:37.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's actually pretty crazy sequence, it's very detailed too.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:37.45,3:42:42.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean just look at how the snipers shooting at Abby here as she advances through this ditch,
Dialogue: 2,3:42:42.10,3:42:46.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,even shoots the body that's laying right on it and part of the body's head blows off,
Dialogue: 2,3:42:46.81,3:42:49.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,which made all of this way more intense for me.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:49.72,3:42:52.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know if this happens every time for everybody,
Dialogue: 2,3:42:52.39,3:42:56.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,or if it was just a coincidental thing that the bullet happened to land right here.
Dialogue: 2,3:42:56.32,3:42:57.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,But either way,
Dialogue: 2,3:42:57.28,3:43:01.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,this spooked me and made me feel as though I was right in the thick of it.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:01.80,3:43:06.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now quick sidebar, remember why Jesse and Ellie separated just a few hours ago
Dialogue: 2,3:43:06.76,3:43:09.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,was because they heard that there was a sniper at the marina,
Dialogue: 2,3:43:09.37,3:43:11.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they assumed that this sniper had to be Tommy.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:11.65,3:43:14.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Jesse and Ellie separated.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:14.23,3:43:18.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Jesse could go and find Tommie and Ellie could leave and go to the aquarium.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:18.79,3:43:24.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also remember the previous sniping section that we had with Ellie in the flashback.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:24.07,3:43:27.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, I said that that wasn't just a one off sniping tutorial,
Dialogue: 2,3:43:27.49,3:43:31.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though it wasn't really going to be used at any other point in the game?
Dialogue: 2,3:43:31.03,3:43:33.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, it was for this very reason.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:33.20,3:43:37.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,They needed to establish that Tommy has sniping experience and is good at what he does.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:37.72,3:43:40.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,And sure enough, who do you think this sniper is?
Dialogue: 2,3:43:40.48,3:43:43.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whether or not the player realizes this in this particular moment,
Dialogue: 2,3:43:43.87,3:43:47.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't think is too important because either way you the way you push up.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:47.05,3:43:49.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I think it's actually probably a cooler moment,
Dialogue: 2,3:43:49.33,3:43:52.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you don't realize it's Tommy handling the sniper rifle.
Dialogue: 2,3:43:52.93,3:43:56.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you're thinking of it purely as an NPC sniping at you,
Dialogue: 2,3:43:56.11,3:43:59.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have a much easier time just plowing through chasing him,
Dialogue: 2,3:43:59.38,3:44:01.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,shooting at him, trying to kill him.
Dialogue: 2,3:44:01.18,3:44:05.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,But once you realize it's a character that you also know and kind of love,
Dialogue: 2,3:44:05.08,3:44:10.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,but is actively threatening the life of another character that you're starting to enjoy and care about,
Dialogue: 2,3:44:10.72,3:44:17.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's that interesting conflict that makes {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} such a strange and bizarre story.
Dialogue: 2,3:44:17.29,3:44:20.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby and Manny push up and eventually get the sniper cornered.
Dialogue: 2,3:44:20.53,3:44:22.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, right as they reached the point,
Dialogue: 2,3:44:22.09,3:44:25.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,when they feel as though they've got him, this happens…
Dialogue: 2,3:44:55.96,3:44:58.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just like that, Manny is dead.
Dialogue: 2,3:44:58.36,3:45:00.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now Abby is mad.
Dialogue: 2,3:45:00.85,3:45:04.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is in my mind, just like the sudden death of Jesse.
Dialogue: 2,3:45:04.12,3:45:06.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,It comes out of nowhere and is a total shock.
Dialogue: 2,3:45:06.99,3:45:09.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, similes all over the place.
Dialogue: 2,3:45:09.46,3:45:13.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie lost a close friend out of nowhere very suddenly,
Dialogue: 2,3:45:13.78,3:45:17.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the player has to also deal with it suddenly and shockingly.
Dialogue: 2,3:45:17.98,3:45:23.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now Abby is losing a close friend of hers and is forced to deal with it in the same way.
Dialogue: 2,3:45:23.68,3:45:25.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you start around a little bit.
Dialogue: 2,3:45:25.27,3:45:26.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Abby pushes through the door.
Dialogue: 2,3:46:14.23,3:46:20.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you just look on her face, you know, Abby knows who this was.
Dialogue: 2,3:46:20.20,3:46:25.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,She knows that Tommy is here and that that is very bad.
Dialogue: 2,3:46:25.93,3:46:31.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is especially bad because Manny just said a few moments ago
Dialogue: 2,3:46:31.00,3:46:32.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you were in the interstate,
Dialogue: 2,3:46:32.68,3:46:38.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,that there's more than one trespassers in town, killing WLF members.
Dialogue: 2,3:46:47.41,3:46:52.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,This means that even if she killed Tommy just now, which is a stretch,
Dialogue: 2,3:46:52.96,3:46:58.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's a lot more people that are in town, killing WLF members.
Dialogue: 2,3:46:58.03,3:47:02.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if Tommy's here, chances are it's other people from Jackson
Dialogue: 2,3:47:02.64,3:47:06.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,coming to get revenge for what she did to Joel.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:06.27,3:47:09.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, Abby doesn't really have the time to freak out about this.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:09.58,3:47:14.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,She puts it out of her mind and heads to the island in a boat which they take from the pier,
Dialogue: 2,3:47:14.08,3:47:19.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same boat and peer that the WLF members use, apparently, occasionally.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:19.18,3:47:23.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,Her goal is simple, she needs to find Lev and get out.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:23.40,3:47:29.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,If she can do that quickly, shall avoid Ellie and her entire revenge crew completely.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:29.26,3:47:32.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby and Yara reach the Scars' island.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:32.20,3:47:36.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yara takes the lead, and brings Abby into the heart of one of their major camps.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:36.76,3:47:41.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the most interesting thing about this actually is that Yara and Lev still buy into the cult,
Dialogue: 2,3:47:41.80,3:47:43.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though they've rejected the leadership.
Dialogue: 2,3:47:58.84,3:48:00.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, I don't really know what to make of this.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:00.97,3:48:06.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,I've heard stories of people that were involved in cults that get out and still partially believe it,
Dialogue: 2,3:48:06.07,3:48:09.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though they feel as though it was corrupted somewhat.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:09.07,3:48:11.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,They feel as though they're still truth to it.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:11.77,3:48:14.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,I am not totally sure, but I thought it was interesting
Dialogue: 2,3:48:14.16,3:48:18.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,because after all, these kids were raised in this cult from the time that they were born.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:18.85,3:48:24.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it makes sense that just because they decided to leave under threat of death,
Dialogue: 2,3:48:24.22,3:48:30.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,they still have some adoration, or at least respect for the cult leaders.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:30.31,3:48:32.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, once in the belly of the island
Dialogue: 2,3:48:32.60,3:48:36.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby and Yara witnessed the Seraphites heading into their armories
Dialogue: 2,3:48:36.04,3:48:39.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,to prepare for the incoming WLF attack, which is beginning.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:39.34,3:48:45.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,They see WLF members heading into the island and are taken by complete surprise by this.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:45.00,3:48:50.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,Honestly it's little surprising to me that the Seraphites didn't see this coming in at least a little bit.
Dialogue: 2,3:48:50.26,3:48:52.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,They have a huge infrastructure throughout the city,
Dialogue: 2,3:48:52.81,3:48:57.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,as we've seen with bridges that co from rooftop to rooftop and they're very sneaky,
Dialogue: 2,3:48:57.55,3:48:59.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it seems as though they should have been able to realize
Dialogue: 2,3:48:59.99,3:49:03.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the WLF was mobilizing for some sort of offensive.
Dialogue: 2,3:49:03.55,3:49:09.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, they were bringing all of their supplies in all of their soldiers into one central area.
Dialogue: 2,3:49:09.76,3:49:14.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,If that doesn't spook you as the leader of the Seraphites, I don't know what will.
Dialogue: 2,3:49:14.13,3:49:16.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless, they're preparing for the offensive.
Dialogue: 2,3:49:16.48,3:49:22.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,This gives you a little bit of space to explore the island and push through to Abby and Yara's house.
Dialogue: 2,3:49:22.18,3:49:27.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,While you're doing this, you find through multiple arenas of Seraphites, all fairly stealth oriented.
Dialogue: 2,3:49:27.58,3:49:29.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless it gives you something to do
Dialogue: 2,3:49:29.86,3:49:34.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,to shake up the monotony of just walking through sequences in watching small cut scenes.
Dialogue: 2,3:49:34.15,3:49:37.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,Eventually you come upon the house, and the following scene plays out.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:01.03,3:51:05.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this doesn't really surprise anyone, she was never going to understand.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:05.47,3:51:09.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's also important to note that this severs all ties for Lev,
Dialogue: 2,3:51:09.94,3:51:13.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,which signal to me that they were actually being set up to leave Seattle completely
Dialogue: 2,3:51:13.68,3:51:15.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,without leaving any baggage behind.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:15.93,3:51:22.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whenever a game or a story starts to sever familial and friendly ties to a character
Dialogue: 2,3:51:22.76,3:51:26.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,usually it means that they are preparing to make some sort of big transition
Dialogue: 2,3:51:26.39,3:51:30.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that they aren't left with the baggage or having to explain that baggage way.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:30.10,3:51:33.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,I, however, don't think that this was particularly necessary.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:33.40,3:51:37.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think leaving Lev and Yara's mom behind really wouldn't have been that big of deal.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:37.93,3:51:41.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,After all, she's a member of a cult, a cult that wants to kill them.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:41.88,3:51:44.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, Abby, Yara and Lev pushed together to the docks
Dialogue: 2,3:51:44.86,3:51:48.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,where they want to find a boat and take that boat back to the aquarium.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:48.28,3:51:50.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,I was never super clear on why
Dialogue: 2,3:51:50.16,3:51:54.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,these characters couldn't just return to the boat that they had just taken to shore.
Dialogue: 2,3:51:54.55,3:51:57.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, they want you to push to the docks,
Dialogue: 2,3:51:57.31,3:52:01.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,grab a separate different boat and escape using that one.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:01.03,3:52:04.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not sure if there was damage to the boat when you reached the island
Dialogue: 2,3:52:04.18,3:52:08.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,or why they can't use the boat they just took from the peer from the WLF.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:08.47,3:52:12.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless they can't for some reason.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:12.01,3:52:13.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,To me, it seems like more of an excuse
Dialogue: 2,3:52:13.61,3:52:17.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,just to get these characters to push into the main center of town
Dialogue: 2,3:52:17.28,3:52:22.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that they can see a new set piece as the WLF and Seraphites' clash.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:22.42,3:52:27.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get it, it makes sense, but it just doesn't seem to logically follow
Dialogue: 2,3:52:27.10,3:52:29.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,considering that they just took a boat to the island
Dialogue: 2,3:52:29.80,3:52:32.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's much closer than the boat they are trying to push to.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:32.56,3:52:33.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:33.05,3:52:36.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,If there's some really good excuse as to why they can't go back to that original boat,
Dialogue: 2,3:52:36.79,3:52:37.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,just let me know.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:37.50,3:52:41.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the three star pushing through an old town that's been completely abandoned,
Dialogue: 2,3:52:41.74,3:52:44.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it looks as though the Seraphites don't even actively patrol it
Dialogue: 2,3:52:44.92,3:52:47.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,since it's from the old world.
Dialogue: 2,3:52:47.08,3:52:49.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everything's quiet, until…
Dialogue: 2,3:55:04.09,3:55:07.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we're paired with Lev against the WLF members
Dialogue: 2,3:55:07.03,3:55:09.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,we previously considered our friends.
Dialogue: 2,3:55:09.24,3:55:12.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,Be honest, it's a really emotionally confusing chunk of the game,
Dialogue: 2,3:55:12.37,3:55:17.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,since there are so many people constantly yelling at Abby asking why she is doing this.
Dialogue: 2,3:55:17.96,3:55:22.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we may not know these characters, but Abby does.
Dialogue: 2,3:55:22.09,3:55:25.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's killing people that she worked with, that she knows,
Dialogue: 2,3:55:25.67,3:55:29.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,who haven't really done anything wrong themselves,
Dialogue: 2,3:55:29.47,3:55:33.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,all for the sake of Lev, somebody that she's not even related to,
Dialogue: 2,3:55:33.96,3:55:37.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,and for whom she has really no reason to care.
Dialogue: 2,3:55:37.63,3:55:41.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's pretty crazy, I mean, who would do that?
Dialogue: 2,3:55:41.65,3:55:44.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,Who would kill people that they've previously worked with
Dialogue: 2,3:55:44.24,3:55:45.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,for somebody that are not related to
Dialogue: 2,3:55:45.92,3:55:49.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,and just care because they've built a connection to them?
Dialogue: 2,3:55:49.06,3:55:49.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh.
Dialogue: 2,3:55:57.07,3:56:00.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Abby and Lev come upon a view of what Isaac's group has done.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:00.28,3:56:04.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're torturing the whole place, they're literally going scorched earth.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:04.24,3:56:08.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so as we push to the marina to get the boat that we need to escape,
Dialogue: 2,3:56:08.17,3:56:13.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,we fight multiple waves of Scars and WLF members at the same time,

Dialogue: 2,3:56:20.42,3:56:25.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,to see all of these enemies interacting with each other and just wiping each other out.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:25.54,3:56:27.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's kind of crazy.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:27.13,3:56:31.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the sequence has actually got a fair amount of crap because there's no infected here,
Dialogue: 2,3:56:31.06,3:56:35.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that to me doesn't make any sense as an accusation or criticism.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:35.77,3:56:41.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is an island, and it's an island that the Seraphites have lived on for a long time.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:41.29,3:56:47.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,They likely cleared out the infected on the island very early on and have kept it contained.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:47.15,3:56:51.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure, it's a little weird to play what many people thought was just going to be a zombie game
Dialogue: 2,3:56:51.48,3:56:55.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,and to not see zombies for hours and hours on end.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:55.12,3:56:58.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I think it makes sense, at least in the world that they've built.
Dialogue: 2,3:56:58.63,3:57:03.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,{\i1}TLOU{\i0} is far more complicated than just a story about zombies.
Dialogue: 2,3:57:03.04,3:57:08.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really upsetting to hear boiled down to that basic and estimation.
Dialogue: 2,3:57:08.92,3:57:11.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, eventually, Abby and Lev find a horse,
Dialogue: 2,3:57:11.71,3:57:15.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,hop on it and ride into the heart of the Seraphites' capital.
Dialogue: 2,3:57:15.82,3:57:20.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,This really is a visually stunning sequence and I really can't complemented enough.

Dialogue: 2,3:57:23.08,3:57:29.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's probably the most impressed I was visually across the entire game, just this one sequence.
Dialogue: 2,3:57:29.29,3:57:32.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Abby rides the horse all the way through to the edge of the docks.

Dialogue: 2,4:03:37.18,4:03:42.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Though based on the pole and the responses that you guys wrote to that survey,
Dialogue: 2,4:03:42.04,4:03:47.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is actually a fair number of people that reached this point in the game and refused to continue.
Dialogue: 2,4:03:47.59,4:03:51.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,They'd played 20, 25, 30 hours of this game,

Dialogue: 2,4:03:57.16,4:03:59.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now at one point, I think that that's a testament
Dialogue: 2,4:03:59.49,4:04:04.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,to just how phenomenally well connected these characters are, to us, the players.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:04.13,4:04:07.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,We care about them, and we don't want to see them mistreated.

Dialogue: 2,4:04:16.14,4:04:19.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thing that could have been a cool moment in terms of player agency
Dialogue: 2,4:04:19.17,4:04:21.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,to resolve this dispute peacefully.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:21.76,4:04:25.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,But with a linear narrative game such as this, that doesn't really work too well.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:25.90,4:04:29.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so, you're forced to engage in this boss fight,
Dialogue: 2,4:04:29.30,4:04:32.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,where Abby, the protagonist in this instance,
Dialogue: 2,4:04:32.02,4:04:34.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,is chasing after the antagonist, which is Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:34.74,4:04:36.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not to say one is right or wrong,
Dialogue: 2,4:04:36.91,4:04:42.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,because protagonist and antagonist are purely based on the perspective of the author.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:42.22,4:04:47.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now as to whether or not this point in the game works, I think there's an active question here.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:47.35,4:04:49.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's probably going to be a little different for everybody.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:49.45,4:04:52.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,Some people probably are going to connect to Abby and Lev
Dialogue: 2,4:04:52.15,4:04:56.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,far more than they connected to Ellie over the course of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0}.
Dialogue: 2,4:04:56.17,4:04:57.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now of course, if you played the original game,
Dialogue: 2,4:04:57.91,4:05:01.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're probably still going to have a lot of that baggage built up from the original game,
Dialogue: 2,4:05:01.79,4:05:03.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,when Ellie was far more likable.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:03.73,4:05:08.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,The sad truth is that Ellie isn't very likable in this game
Dialogue: 2,4:05:08.02,4:05:10.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,as I've said multiple times throughout this critique.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:10.75,4:05:14.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for me I found myself just sitting and staring at my screen for a moment
Dialogue: 2,4:05:14.70,4:05:17.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,when I realized what I was being asked to do here.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:17.65,4:05:21.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think it was because the game didn't completely succeed in what it was trying to do
Dialogue: 2,4:05:21.79,4:05:23.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,the first time I played the game.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:23.29,4:05:27.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Namely, Naughty Dog, wanted to make the player feel as though killing Ellie was justified
Dialogue: 2,4:05:27.81,4:05:32.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,at the very least, just as justifiable as Ellie killing Abby.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:32.50,4:05:35.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the reason I don't think this has worked too well
Dialogue: 2,4:05:35.44,4:05:38.71,辉英,,0,0,0,,is because the people that Ellie has taken from Abby
Dialogue: 2,4:05:38.71,4:05:41.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,were all effectively B-Class characters.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:41.35,4:05:47.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,Owen? Yeah, he's great, but he's supporting and he's not particularly charismatic.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:47.05,4:05:49.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,Definitely not a leading character.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:49.36,4:05:55.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, on the other hand, if Ellie shot and killed Lev right as they enter the theater,
Dialogue: 2,4:05:55.06,4:05:57.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can't help but feel as though this would have worked much better.
Dialogue: 2,4:05:57.85,4:06:00.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,Likely the player playing as Abby in this case
Dialogue: 2,4:06:00.44,4:06:05.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,would feel much more justified in chasing down Ellie if this had happened.
Dialogue: 2,4:06:05.68,4:06:08.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,But nonetheless, Abby hunts Ellie down in a boss fight
Dialogue: 2,4:06:08.94,4:06:13.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's basically identical to the one that ended the winter chapter in the first game
Dialogue: 2,4:06:13.43,4:06:16.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,against everybody's favorite cannibal king.
Dialogue: 2,4:06:16.39,4:06:19.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know if it's just lazy, repetitive game design,
Dialogue: 2,4:06:19.03,4:06:24.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,or if this is meant to be an actual reversal and similarly in and of itself.
Dialogue: 2,4:06:24.13,4:06:25.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 2,4:06:25.12,4:06:28.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it does seem shockingly similar in terms of how it's laid out
Dialogue: 2,4:06:28.97,4:06:31.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the structure of this boss fight.
Dialogue: 2,4:06:31.27,4:06:35.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe it's a coincidence, maybe it's something very intentional, I'm not sure.
Dialogue: 2,4:06:35.68,4:06:39.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,But at the very least, I thought that it was a direct parallel.
Dialogue: 2,4:06:39.31,4:06:43.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,The whole thing wraps up with one of the hardest to watch cut scenes
Dialogue: 2,4:06:43.21,4:06:45.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,in all of gaming as far as I'm concerned.
Dialogue: 2,4:07:54.67,4:07:58.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,She stopped short… after Lev calls out to her,

Dialogue: 2,4:10:10.51,4:10:15.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't think it's controversial to say that Abby, pretty clearly won this exchange.
Dialogue: 2,4:10:15.61,4:10:20.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if she wanted to, could have killed Ellie and Dina easily.
Dialogue: 2,4:10:20.50,4:10:26.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,But out of some sense of dignity or grace and forgiveness, pride,
Dialogue: 2,4:10:26.86,4:10:29.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,whatever it may be, she decided to spare them.
Dialogue: 2,4:10:29.95,4:10:33.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,So while this may be a resolution of the conflict from Abby's perspective,
Dialogue: 2,4:10:33.97,4:10:36.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,she's moving on and wants to forget about all of this.
Dialogue: 2,4:10:36.85,4:10:41.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not a resolution for Ellie, for Tommy, or for Dina,
Dialogue: 2,4:10:41.02,4:10:42.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,as we'll see in the following scenes.
Dialogue: 2,4:10:42.97,4:10:45.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think the really frustrating thing for the player
Dialogue: 2,4:10:45.24,4:10:50.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that the entire story has been building to this moment, this exchange, this fight,
Dialogue: 2,4:10:50.43,4:10:53.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,throughout the entirety of the game play time.
Dialogue: 2,4:10:53.50,4:10:57.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now that we've reached it, it doesn't resolve itself at all.
Dialogue: 2,4:10:57.04,4:11:01.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,And instead, Ellie, Dina and Tommy are left bleeding out on the floor,
Dialogue: 2,4:11:01.51,4:11:04.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,and in the case of Jesse, he's dead.
Dialogue: 2,4:11:04.18,4:11:08.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,And especially considering how emotionally exhausting the scheme is to play,
Dialogue: 2,4:11:08.62,4:11:12.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's really difficult to ask the player to buckle down for another
Dialogue: 2,4:11:12.73,4:11:17.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,however many hours it's going to take to get through what is effectively the epilogue.
Dialogue: 2,4:11:17.32,4:11:22.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I know it's not technically an epilogue because the story hasn't resolved itself.
Dialogue: 2,4:11:22.09,4:11:26.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's still part of the main story as we move into this next chapter.
Dialogue: 2,4:11:26.11,4:11:29.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,But still it feels as though it separate from the main game.
Dialogue: 2,4:11:29.80,4:11:34.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after a lot of contemplation, I am not sure if Naughty Dog wanted this to be the case,
Dialogue: 2,4:11:34.63,4:11:40.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,or if they even meant for this to feel so different from the core body of the game in Seattle.
Dialogue: 2,4:11:40.57,4:11:46.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems to be pretty clear that shifting pace very sharply after all of the events of the core game,
Dialogue: 2,4:11:46.09,4:11:51.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to hit the player in a fairly significant way such that they're going to feel very differently.
Dialogue: 2,4:11:51.52,4:11:53.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's something a good number of developers have spoken of
Dialogue: 2,4:11:53.89,4:11:57.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,in GDC conference, speeches, and things like that,
Dialogue: 2,4:11:57.76,4:12:02.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,where they express this frustration with working on a project for years and years and years
Dialogue: 2,4:12:02.66,4:12:04.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,and losing perspective on it,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:04.36,4:12:08.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,such that they forget how it would actually feel to play it for the first time.
Dialogue: 2,4:12:08.74,4:12:11.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,In other words, when you're working really hard on something,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:11.32,4:12:16.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,you develop a sort of tunnel vision and you lose perspective on what it looks like from the outside.
Dialogue: 2,4:12:16.96,4:12:18.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,It may seem great to you,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:18.61,4:12:21.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,but just because you're so focused on the little details,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:21.55,4:12:23.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,you might have lost sight of the overall picture.
Dialogue: 2,4:12:23.92,4:12:29.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or vice versa, you are focused on the broader picture, so you lose sight of the minutiae.
Dialogue: 2,4:12:29.09,4:12:33.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,Regardless, this final fight leaves the player feeling kind of strange,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:33.09,4:12:34.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least it did for me;
Dialogue: 2,4:12:34.48,4:12:37.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,and based on a lot of your responses to the survey,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:37.12,4:12:40.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,it left a lot of you feeling very strange as well.
Dialogue: 2,4:12:40.15,4:12:41.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I don't know about you,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:41.41,4:12:45.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,but often strangers into feeling I would associate with quality.
Dialogue: 2,4:12:45.97,4:12:50.21,辉英,,0,0,0,,But with all that said after this initial chunk of the game is over,
Dialogue: 2,4:12:50.21,4:12:53.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,the player's left with a lot of questions unresolved.
Dialogue: 2,4:12:53.02,4:12:55.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,For instance, is Dina okay?
Dialogue: 2,4:12:55.45,4:13:00.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is she going to survive having her face bashed into cement multiple times?
Dialogue: 2,4:13:00.32,4:13:03.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,While it's technically it wasn't cement, they put down a particle board
Dialogue: 2,4:13:03.99,4:13:07.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that they could have an excuse as to why she survived, its good detail.
Dialogue: 2,4:13:07.54,4:13:08.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm glad that they put this in there
Dialogue: 2,4:13:08.87,4:13:12.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that it's not totally unbelievable that she survived a cracked skull.
Dialogue: 2,4:13:12.91,4:13:18.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,But still this is a pretty rough thing to go through, especially when you're pregnant.
Dialogue: 2,4:13:18.49,4:13:21.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the player's left wondering whether or not she's going to be okay.
Dialogue: 2,4:13:21.52,4:13:24.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,You also have to ask yourself what's going to happen to this couple
Dialogue: 2,4:13:24.64,4:13:27.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the incoming baby comes along now that Jesse's gone.
Dialogue: 2,4:13:27.79,4:13:29.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,How is Jackson going to handle
Dialogue: 2,4:13:29.80,4:13:34.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,having so many of their best and brightest, decimated by an out of state group?
Dialogue: 2,4:13:34.69,4:13:38.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can, or will they ever be able to adjust?
Dialogue: 2,4:13:38.35,4:13:40.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, we don't ever really get to know.
Dialogue: 2,4:13:40.28,4:13:43.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because in the following sequences, we never return back to Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,4:13:43.72,4:13:47.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,And perhaps the most important question is what does Ellie do now?
Dialogue: 2,4:13:47.68,4:13:49.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is she capable of moving on?
Dialogue: 2,4:13:49.54,4:13:51.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that something that Ellie would even want?
Dialogue: 2,4:13:51.58,4:13:54.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that something that would even satisfy the player?
Dialogue: 2,4:13:54.46,4:13:59.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or are we setting ourselves up for one last hurrah to try and resolve everything
Dialogue: 2,4:13:59.77,4:14:04.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,in a desperate attempt to justify the events of the core game itself?
Dialogue: 2,4:14:04.90,4:14:09.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just like {\i1}Red Dead Redemption 2{\i0}, it's gonna end up being the latter.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:09.46,4:14:14.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,Answers to these questions will mostly come, but for now we're left in the dark.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:14.60,4:14:18.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,After cut to black, after this fight, we open up on a farm.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:18.76,4:14:24.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's an expansive wheat field with a farm house off in the distance and a barn behind it.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:24.19,4:14:25.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's very calm and picturesque.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:25.96,4:14:27.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,Inside we see Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,4:14:27.79,4:14:31.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,she seems, healed up and relatively healthy,
Dialogue: 2,4:14:31.36,4:14:36.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she's holding Joel's old broken watch that he got from Sarah in the first game.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:36.07,4:14:41.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a not so subtle way of reminding the player that Ellie is still thinking about Joel,
Dialogue: 2,4:14:41.74,4:14:43.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that she hasn't moved on.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:43.42,4:14:45.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also, there's a baby now.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:45.91,4:14:52.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,This reaffirms that it's been a good long while since the events of the previous scene.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:52.03,4:14:54.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Furthermore, we see Dina in the kitchen,
Dialogue: 2,4:14:54.04,4:14:56.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it seems as though she's recovered just fine,
Dialogue: 2,4:14:56.74,4:14:59.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she also has her mom jeans coming in clutch.
Dialogue: 2,4:14:59.98,4:15:03.01,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean maybe, it's stupid, I'm honestly not sure what it is.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:03.01,4:15:07.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when I saw Dina in this scene, I thought that she just she looked like a mom.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:07.48,4:15:11.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know what it is, maybe they bushed up her eyebrows, and that did it.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:11.20,4:15:15.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe it's the strange outfit she has on or the fact that she's doing dishes.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:15.10,4:15:16.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know what it is.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:16.93,4:15:21.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they seemingly did a good job of making her appear as a mother,
Dialogue: 2,4:15:21.40,4:15:23.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,I guess props to Naughty Dog.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:23.05,4:15:26.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, everything seems calm and relatively happy,
Dialogue: 2,4:15:26.80,4:15:30.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,but nothing ever ends happily in this world.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:30.34,4:15:32.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,So of course this won't last for long.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:32.83,4:15:37.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie does some routine chores, you dance with Dina a little bit, and you explore the house.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:37.48,4:15:41.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,Fun little note here is that Ellie actually has a good amount of art in the house
Dialogue: 2,4:15:41.77,4:15:43.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,that was taken from Joel's house.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:43.81,4:15:44.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a nice touch,
Dialogue: 2,4:15:44.74,4:15:47.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it makes sense since she would likely want to hold on to parts of him,
Dialogue: 2,4:15:47.89,4:15:50.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,as we just saw earlier when she had his watch.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:50.32,4:15:52.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just a really sweet little detail,
Dialogue: 2,4:15:52.27,4:15:56.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially considering the fact that the player will likely not notice this,
Dialogue: 2,4:15:56.38,4:15:58.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,at least on their first run through the game.
Dialogue: 2,4:15:58.36,4:16:03.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,I only noticed it once I spent a lot of time recording footage for this video
Dialogue: 2,4:16:03.22,4:16:05.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,going back through environments very carefully.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:05.80,4:16:10.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,I noticed that in Joel's house there are a lot of really nice looking paintings that I liked.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:10.48,4:16:13.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, I even reference those earlier in this very video.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:13.99,4:16:18.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then when I went back through this section, I noticed that those paintings looked similar.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:18.59,4:16:23.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I initially thought that they were just reusing assets which is pretty common in game development.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:23.11,4:16:26.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,But upon further inspection and deliberation,
Dialogue: 2,4:16:26.14,4:16:28.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,I realized that this was actually an artistic choice,
Dialogue: 2,4:16:28.87,4:16:34.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,because Ellie is trying to keep and bring parts of Joel into her life even still.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:34.00,4:16:36.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, after exploring the house and chilling with Dina for a little bit,
Dialogue: 2,4:16:36.97,4:16:41.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dina asks Ellie to bring in the sheep from outside and put them into the barn.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:41.08,4:16:43.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Ellie goes, and does this with the baby.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:43.66,4:16:46.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after doing it, Ellie spots one little straggler.
Dialogue: 2,4:16:46.60,4:16:50.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there's probably leads to the fastest mood shift of the whole game.
Dialogue: 2,4:17:46.48,4:17:50.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,I really think that this moment is meant to hit the player just as hard as it hits Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,4:17:50.41,4:17:52.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everything seems fine, calm and relaxed.
Dialogue: 2,4:17:52.54,4:17:56.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems as though they've moved on from a lot of the struggles of the core game
Dialogue: 2,4:17:56.73,4:17:59.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that their living a happy, satisfied life together.
Dialogue: 2,4:17:59.86,4:18:02.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now everything is falling apart.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:02.68,4:18:05.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie's mind won't let her forget what happened to Joel,
Dialogue: 2,4:18:05.98,4:18:09.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she's clearly been unable to move on.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:09.10,4:18:14.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dina knows this and is understanding because she knows that Ellie can't help this.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:14.17,4:18:16.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's something beyond her control,
Dialogue: 2,4:18:16.18,4:18:20.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,just like anybody else who suffers from panic attacks can't really control it.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:20.32,4:18:22.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,It just happens when it happens.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:22.36,4:18:24.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the game keeps carrying along, relatively quickly.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:24.94,4:18:28.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,We jump to the next day and there is a guest in the house.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:28.42,4:18:29.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's Tommy.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:29.26,4:18:32.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, he's survived the shot to the head.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:32.41,4:18:37.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,He's currently got a lot of damage that he's dealing with and he even struggles walking.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:37.15,4:18:41.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, he took a bullet to the head, so… it's understandable.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:41.41,4:18:42.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,Clearly he's not in good shape,
Dialogue: 2,4:18:42.94,4:18:46.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,but he does not want to let Abby get away with what she's done.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:46.75,4:18:49.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,He says that he's tracked her to a location in Santa Barbara.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:49.93,4:18:51.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, even though he doesn't state it outright,
Dialogue: 2,4:18:51.85,4:18:54.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's pretty clear that he's unable to go and chase her himself.
Dialogue: 2,4:18:54.97,4:18:58.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,He can barely walk after all, and he's missing an eye now,
Dialogue: 2,4:18:58.09,4:19:01.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,so he wouldn't exactly be much help if he were to go.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:01.51,4:19:06.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so he's come to Ellie to proposition her for this revenge plot.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:06.16,4:19:08.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now initially, this might seem relatively far fetched
Dialogue: 2,4:19:08.69,4:19:14.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Tommy was able to track her down to a city that is very far away from where they are at.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:14.65,4:19:18.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,Apparently they're just outside of Jackson in the surrounding area,
Dialogue: 2,4:19:18.67,4:19:22.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they're local, but they have moved out away from the core group.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:22.99,4:19:26.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, I don't think this is as far as stretch as it might initially seem.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:26.56,4:19:29.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tommy has a ton of connections to the Fireflies.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:29.29,4:19:30.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you remember from earlier,
Dialogue: 2,4:19:30.58,4:19:36.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Owen said that he wanted to go to Santa Barbara on the boat with Mel, Abby, Yara and Lev,
Dialogue: 2,4:19:36.85,4:19:40.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,because he thought that there were going to be a lot of Fireflies there
Dialogue: 2,4:19:40.36,4:19:42.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they could connect and join up with.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:42.57,4:19:46.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,Using the same contacts, it seems Tommy was able to track
Dialogue: 2,4:19:46.28,4:19:54.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,a very buff woman with a small young Asian individual by her side to this area.
Dialogue: 2,4:19:54.67,4:19:59.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it seems relatively plausible that they would be able to track her to this point,
Dialogue: 2,4:19:59.14,4:20:05.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially if Tommy were to put out an APB on this individual trying to find her,
Dialogue: 2,4:20:05.05,4:20:06.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,which he's clearly done.
Dialogue: 2,4:20:06.25,4:20:11.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, after hearing his proposition, Ellie and Dina strongly reject the idea.

Dialogue: 2,4:20:13.03,4:20:16.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or at the very least, Dina is, and Ellie going along with it.
Dialogue: 2,4:20:16.36,4:20:18.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now they have too much to lose.
Dialogue: 2,4:20:18.73,4:20:22.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,They have a house of family and of course each other.
Dialogue: 2,4:20:22.49,4:20:24.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,They've been there, done that.

Dialogue: 2,4:20:33.75,4:20:37.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,since she told him that she was going to do whatever it took to get revenge.
Dialogue: 2,4:20:37.99,4:20:43.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's an understandable reaction, considering that Tommy is still furious about his brother's death,
Dialogue: 2,4:20:43.03,4:20:46.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that she has now permanently scarred him.
Dialogue: 2,4:20:46.48,4:20:52.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it is a little startling to see Tommy react in such a sharp way towards Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,4:20:52.15,4:20:55.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, I can't think of a time when we've ever seen Tommy
Dialogue: 2,4:20:55.55,4:21:01.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,react or talk to somebody in this way throughout the entirety of this franchise.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:01.12,4:21:06.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,The closest example would be in the first game when Joel and Tommy got frustrated with each other
Dialogue: 2,4:21:06.76,4:21:08.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,when they initially visited the power plant.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:08.80,4:21:12.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,But even that wasn't this sharp or direct.

Dialogue: 2,4:21:17.11,4:21:19.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,where it can still be overheard by Ellie.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:19.81,4:21:22.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,But Ellie is still caught up in all of this.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:22.72,4:21:27.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,She knows that Dina is not OK with her going and trying to end this once and for all,
Dialogue: 2,4:21:27.61,4:21:30.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,but she's still pondering everything.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:30.31,4:21:31.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, in the next scene,
Dialogue: 2,4:21:31.75,4:21:34.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,we see her walking aimlessly through the house in the middle of the night,
Dialogue: 2,4:21:34.93,4:21:37.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,unable to sleep and unsure of what to do.

Dialogue: 2,4:21:45.70,4:21:47.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it doesn't seem to do anything.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:47.74,4:21:50.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, it seems to make everything worse.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:50.32,4:21:53.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,We then jumped to the scene of the Jackson Winter Ball
Dialogue: 2,4:21:53.16,4:21:56.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we have only heard discussed up to this point.
Dialogue: 2,4:21:56.32,4:21:59.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,It plays out just like we saw in the trailer before launch,
Dialogue: 2,4:21:59.62,4:22:04.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,except that now we see the events described in the first hours of the game.
Dialogue: 2,4:22:04.33,4:22:09.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,After the happenings of the trailer, culminating in the kiss between Ellie and Dina,
Dialogue: 2,4:22:09.16,4:22:13.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,an old man makes a disparaging comments about Dina and Ellie kissing.
Dialogue: 2,4:22:13.08,4:22:17.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,Joel steps in and pushes them which upsets Ellie for some reason.
Dialogue: 2,4:22:17.62,4:22:23.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,Likely because she feels as though Joel is once again keeping her from fighting her own fights.
Dialogue: 2,4:22:23.23,4:22:25.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't worry, we'll talk about this more in just a little bit.
Dialogue: 2,4:22:25.66,4:22:30.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, back in the present, Ellie has decided that she has to take Abby on,
Dialogue: 2,4:22:30.44,4:22:32.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,to finish this once, and for all,
Dialogue: 2,4:22:32.62,4:22:36.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,Perhaps reminded of this confrontation with the old, bigoted man,
Dialogue: 2,4:22:36.34,4:22:40.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,she realizes that she needs to fight her own fights and finish this,
Dialogue: 2,4:22:40.27,4:22:42.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,otherwise she won't be able to live with herself.
Dialogue: 2,4:22:42.34,4:22:45.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, this time she's not just leaving Jackson behind,
Dialogue: 2,4:22:45.82,4:22:50.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,she's abandoning her entire family, this whole thing that she's built up.
Dialogue: 2,4:22:50.14,4:22:53.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once again it's hard to feel sorry for Ellie here,
Dialogue: 2,4:22:53.62,4:22:55.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially since most people I think
Dialogue: 2,4:22:55.98,4:23:00.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,would say that she should have left well enough alone and not chased Abby again.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:00.07,4:23:04.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,Literally every single person I've talked to about this final decision by Ellie
Dialogue: 2,4:23:04.42,4:23:07.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,to leave everything, and Chase Abby down again
Dialogue: 2,4:23:07.56,4:23:12.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,has said that this was the wrong decision, and that they didn't want her to do it.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:12.31,4:23:15.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,They wanted her to forgive Abby to move on.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:15.55,4:23:20.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's yet another example of how emotionally exhausting the scheme can be to play,
Dialogue: 2,4:23:20.26,4:23:23.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,because when you don't agree with what the characters are doing,
Dialogue: 2,4:23:23.80,4:23:25.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,you start to lose sympathy with them.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:25.90,4:23:29.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that makes it harder to empathize with everything that they're going through.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:29.98,4:23:32.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie starts packing up her things when Dina finds her.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:32.89,4:23:35.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dina clearly knows that Ellie's been considering this
Dialogue: 2,4:23:35.61,4:23:38.89,辉英,,0,0,0,,but is terrified to see her actually going through with it.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:38.89,4:23:40.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dina begs her to come back to bed,
Dialogue: 2,4:23:40.51,4:23:45.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,to move on, to forget about everything, to stay with the family and not do this.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:45.52,4:23:48.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,But Ellie says she has no choice and has to.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:48.61,4:23:52.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dina makes it very clear that she's not going to do this whole thing again.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:52.81,4:23:54.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's not going to go and help her.
Dialogue: 2,4:23:54.49,4:23:58.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if Ellie decides that this is what's most important to her,
Dialogue: 2,4:23:58.06,4:24:04.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,she shouldn't expect to find her and the baby there when or if she gets back alive.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:04.63,4:24:07.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,She is effectively giving Ellie an ultimatum.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:07.39,4:24:09.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,Choose Abby, or choose Dina,
Dialogue: 2,4:24:09.94,4:24:13.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the family, and everything that she's built up with her.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:13.78,4:24:15.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie chooses Abby.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:15.38,4:24:20.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, giving the player very little reason to feel bad or sorry for her,
Dialogue: 2,4:24:20.84,4:24:25.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,Losing Dina, and for all of the pain that she's likely to encounter
Dialogue: 2,4:24:25.18,4:24:27.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the next few hours as the game wraps up.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:27.49,4:24:30.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Ellie leaves, Dina's left devastated.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:30.97,4:24:33.18,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Naughty Dog pulls a fake out.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:33.18,4:24:34.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,We jumped to California.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:34.54,4:24:38.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a market set difference, everything's very dry and dead.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:38.50,4:24:42.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,The chapter opens up with the camera focused on a pair of Converse.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:42.10,4:24:45.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anyone who's played the first game knows that this is Ellie signature shoe.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:45.97,4:24:47.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the camera pans up,
Dialogue: 2,4:24:47.62,4:24:52.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we see that it's Lev wearing the shoes and Abby's walking alongside him.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:52.27,4:24:54.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this is a bit obvious for me,
Dialogue: 2,4:24:54.13,4:24:59.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's clearly setting up the parallel between Abby and Joel and Ellie and Lev.
Dialogue: 2,4:24:59.74,4:25:04.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whether you think those are fair to draw as comparisons or similes is up to you,
Dialogue: 2,4:25:04.24,4:25:06.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that's clearly what the writers are doing.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:06.43,4:25:08.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie is known for her Converse,
Dialogue: 2,4:25:08.20,4:25:12.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,and in fact it's one of the staples of her outfit in the first game,
Dialogue: 2,4:25:12.31,4:25:14.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,and even throughout most of the second game.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:14.35,4:25:20.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,To so clearly show these shoes to me is hitting the player over the head with this simile.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:20.92,4:25:23.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now Abby and Lev are looking for the Fireflies
Dialogue: 2,4:25:23.16,4:25:25.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,hoping to find a new home to which they can belong.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:25.56,4:25:29.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, remembering that Owen suggested Santa Barbara way back when.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:29.80,4:25:33.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now they had a tip that 2425 Constance in Santa Barbara
Dialogue: 2,4:25:33.93,4:25:36.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,was a hideout for the underground Firefly network.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:36.97,4:25:40.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so after Abby and Lev fight through a few infected,
Dialogue: 2,4:25:40.87,4:25:42.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,they worked their way to the basement of the house,
Dialogue: 2,4:25:42.88,4:25:44.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the pair discovers a radio.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:44.92,4:25:47.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after a few attempts they connect with somebody.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:47.59,4:25:52.69,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it seems as though Abby and Lev have found their new home and will be safe after all.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:52.69,4:25:55.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,But again, no, everything is sad and terrible.
Dialogue: 2,4:25:55.78,4:26:01.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nothing's gonna end happily, so just get ready, everything is going to go terribly wrong.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:01.45,4:26:05.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the two set up a meet up point where they're gonna head to meet up with the Fireflies.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:05.47,4:26:06.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,As the pair leaves the house,
Dialogue: 2,4:26:06.70,4:26:10.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are intercepted by a small gang as they exit out the front of the house.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:10.78,4:26:13.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems that these people are involved in the slave trade,
Dialogue: 2,4:26:13.57,4:26:17.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,which, to be honest, I'm stunned took this long to be featured in the game.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:17.50,4:26:20.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're beaten, tied up and taken away,
Dialogue: 2,4:26:20.17,4:26:25.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,presumably to be entered into the slave trade and used for manual labor.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:25.39,4:26:27.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,We then cut to Ellie, who was closing in quickly.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:27.88,4:26:30.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's found their boat and begins pushing into their location
Dialogue: 2,4:26:30.72,4:26:34.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,after finding a map that has 2425 Constance marked on it.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:34.15,4:26:36.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,As you push through multiple houses and streets,
Dialogue: 2,4:26:36.94,4:26:40.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the last zombie hurrah combat in the entire game.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:40.24,4:26:41.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,So be sure to enjoy it.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:41.36,4:26:45.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because after this Naughty Dog is going to be sticking with human enemies exclusively.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:45.46,4:26:49.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,Except for one small exception, which I'll point out in a moment.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:49.09,4:26:52.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,But still, it's going to be pretty much all humans after this.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:52.03,4:26:55.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie pushes her way through an initial neighborhood and starts climbing down a hill.
Dialogue: 2,4:26:55.84,4:26:56.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,When this happens.
Dialogue: 2,4:28:59.56,4:29:02.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now these guys are obviously super dome.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:02.17,4:29:07.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you have to ask yourself as the player, what's keeping you going?
Dialogue: 2,4:29:07.16,4:29:12.22,辉英,,0,0,0,,Other than just going through the motions of continuing to do what the game asks you to do.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:12.22,4:29:15.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,One of the best things about the early hours of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0}
Dialogue: 2,4:29:15.02,4:29:21.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that the player is completely on board with Ellie's drive and mission to take out Abby.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:21.34,4:29:22.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as the game goes on,
Dialogue: 2,4:29:22.54,4:29:28.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,you also start to lose that motivation once you start to sympathize with Abby and her crew.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:28.06,4:29:31.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you end up very conflicted in that final boss fight
Dialogue: 2,4:29:31.15,4:29:34.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you don't want to do anything or hurt either one of these characters.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:34.66,4:29:37.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now the players still feels like that.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:37.48,4:29:41.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,And yet the game designers are asking Ellie to chase down Abby,
Dialogue: 2,4:29:41.44,4:29:44.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though it's caused her to lose everything at this point
Dialogue: 2,4:29:44.68,4:29:48.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,and will likely not result in the conclusion
Dialogue: 2,4:29:48.46,4:29:51.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,that either the player or Ellie he would be satisfied with.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:51.64,4:29:53.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,Some people have said that this is a pacing issue,
Dialogue: 2,4:29:53.83,4:29:56.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I don't think that that's the right way to phrase it.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:56.44,4:29:59.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,If anything, I think that this is a motivational issue.
Dialogue: 2,4:29:59.17,4:30:03.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think the player doesn't feel motivated to continue on this mission
Dialogue: 2,4:30:03.24,4:30:05.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they're being asked to embark on.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:05.59,4:30:07.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now of course, you could have a game
Dialogue: 2,4:30:07.07,4:30:11.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,that motivates the player to continue playing purely by way of its game play,
Dialogue: 2,4:30:11.14,4:30:14.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and there is no narrative reason to continue at all.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:14.32,4:30:17.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,However, that's not how Naughty Dog games work.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:17.29,4:30:23.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,Naughty Dog games are entirely about motivating the player by way of this narrative drive.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:23.77,4:30:27.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'll be honest, it's really too bad that this falls so flat
Dialogue: 2,4:30:27.32,4:30:29.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,because this should be the climax of the game.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:29.62,4:30:32.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,But instead it feels as though it's a total chore,
Dialogue: 2,4:30:32.95,4:30:37.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the player doesn't feel as though Ellie is justified in what she's doing.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:37.09,4:30:40.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,And certainly Ellie is even frustrated with her own decision.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:40.81,4:30:45.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only reason Ellie is continuing on it is because she feels an obligation to Joel,
Dialogue: 2,4:30:45.49,4:30:48.73,辉英,,0,0,0,,an obligation that's going to be resolved very shortly.
Dialogue: 2,4:30:48.73,4:30:54.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,But even so, the player pushes on into the slave trader camped known as "the Resort".
Dialogue: 2,4:30:54.46,4:30:56.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not a sassy or funny name,
Dialogue: 2,4:30:56.44,4:31:01.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's just that it's an old resort, so they call it "the Resort", it's pretty simple.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:01.85,4:31:05.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this section does feature my favorite gun of the entire game,
Dialogue: 2,4:31:05.44,4:31:10.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's so damn powerful that it removes any need for any finesse whatsoever.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:10.99,4:31:12.97,辉英,,0,0,0,,So with this new found super weapon,
Dialogue: 2,4:31:12.97,4:31:17.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,you fight your way through the Resorts main building where all of the slaves are housed.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:17.62,4:31:20.23,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to be honest, the section is actually pretty bad,
Dialogue: 2,4:31:20.23,4:31:24.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially when considering that it is the final section of the game.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:24.55,4:31:30.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the final game play section of the game other than the final boss quote-unquote, "fight",
Dialogue: 2,4:31:30.76,4:31:33.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,and its painfully uninteresting.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:33.10,4:31:35.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only thing that shakes it up a little bit
Dialogue: 2,4:31:35.32,4:31:40.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,is having zombies chained up that you can release on the human NPCs.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:40.36,4:31:43.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,But other than that, there's really nothing that's interesting about this level.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:43.57,4:31:47.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even though zombies, you shoot off their chains or disconnect them,
Dialogue: 2,4:31:47.17,4:31:50.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they started attacking the other people, the other NPCs
Dialogue: 2,4:31:50.48,4:31:53.56,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then you just end up having to kill zombies before they come to you
Dialogue: 2,4:31:53.56,4:31:56.77,辉英,,0,0,0,,if they are not already killed by those human NPCs.
Dialogue: 2,4:31:56.77,4:32:00.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it even by itself doesn't do anything new or different.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:00.61,4:32:02.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just bland.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:02.61,4:32:06.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's unfortunate because it really should be the climax,
Dialogue: 2,4:32:06.31,4:32:09.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,but instead it just lands super flat.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:09.28,4:32:10.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,I was really surprised to see this
Dialogue: 2,4:32:10.82,4:32:14.05,辉英,,0,0,0,,because usually Naughty Dog is pretty good about sticking the landing.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:14.05,4:32:18.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,They go crazy, big and elaborate in the final sections of the game,
Dialogue: 2,4:32:18.31,4:32:21.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether you're looking at {\i1}Uncharted{\i0} or even the original {\i1}TLOU{\i0} game
Dialogue: 2,4:32:21.88,4:32:25.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,where they really push the boundary of difficulty.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:25.27,4:32:27.64,辉英,,0,0,0,,But here it just doesn't work.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:27.64,4:32:32.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,But even so, after killing countless slavers, Ellie finds her way to the beach.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:32.17,4:32:34.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's told by several other prisoners
Dialogue: 2,4:32:34.04,4:32:38.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,that this is where Abby and Lev have been moved after they tried to escape.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:38.26,4:32:41.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,And usually the slaves are left here hung up until they die.
Dialogue: 2,4:32:41.74,4:32:44.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I gotta say it's pretty surreal once you reach this beach
Dialogue: 2,4:32:44.96,4:32:47.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what Ellie finds there is pretty upsetting.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:08.20,4:33:12.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now there's actually a fake out with the girl in the center that has the braid.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:12.55,4:33:16.42,辉英,,0,0,0,,It looks like Abby, especially Abby the last time that we saw her.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:16.42,4:33:18.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's not Abby.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:18.60,4:33:21.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby in fact, you just walked past.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:21.81,4:33:24.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,And she's in much worse shape.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:39.17,4:33:42.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,Truely, she doesn't even look like the same person.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:42.46,4:33:46.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it took a moment that Abby recognizes Ellie here,
Dialogue: 2,4:33:46.06,4:33:48.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,but she's not interested in fighting.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:48.37,4:33:52.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead, the moment that Ellie cuts her down, she goes to help Lev.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:52.66,4:33:56.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby then carries Lev into the distance despite her weakness.
Dialogue: 2,4:33:56.68,4:33:58.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they come up on the same boat
Dialogue: 2,4:33:58.55,4:34:02.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we've seen in the title screen every time we booted up the game to this point.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:02.95,4:34:07.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Even now, Abby is purely concerned with taking care of Lev,
Dialogue: 2,4:34:07.06,4:34:09.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,making sure that they are able to get out safely.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:09.94,4:34:13.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,She even leads Ellie to the boats to help her escape.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:13.33,4:34:16.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm aware that Ellie has come to kill her
Dialogue: 2,4:34:16.84,4:34:20.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and enact the revenge that she sought out initially.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:20.32,4:34:25.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,As far as we know, Abby may think that Ellie was being housed as a slave herself,
Dialogue: 2,4:34:25.39,4:34:27.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,and has escaped to this point.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:27.34,4:34:29.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,But whatever it may be,
Dialogue: 2,4:34:29.08,4:34:31.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby gets down to the boat area
Dialogue: 2,4:34:31.52,4:34:36.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Ellie still wounded from the tree branch that she was impaled with,
Dialogue: 2,4:34:36.04,4:34:40.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,and Abby, wounded from the weeks or months of torture,
Dialogue: 2,4:34:40.41,4:34:46.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,at their very end, have to face off in one final painful battle.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:46.27,4:34:50.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie demands to fight with Abby to finish this once and for all.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:50.31,4:34:55.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,She even takes out her switch blade and threatens to kill Lev if Abby doesn't engage with her.
Dialogue: 2,4:34:55.48,4:34:57.79,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so left with no choice,
Dialogue: 2,4:34:57.79,4:35:03.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,Abby decides that she'll fight Ellie, not for her, not for Ellie, but for Lev.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:03.67,4:35:07.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you show to player this fight scene at the very start of the game,
Dialogue: 2,4:35:07.90,4:35:10.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,it would probably give them a lot of pleasure.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:10.45,4:35:16.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,It would feel good for the player to literally hack and slash the person that killed Joel to pieces.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:16.66,4:35:20.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,But instead, it's absolutely horrible, it's pathetic.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:20.95,4:35:25.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,And no part of this feels like a comeuppance or like justice.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:25.06,4:35:29.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think if anything, this means that the game's arc worked.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:29.50,4:35:33.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,It actually went from me wanting to kill Joel's killer
Dialogue: 2,4:35:33.67,4:35:36.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,to wanting to forgive her and move on.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:36.43,4:35:38.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's simple, but it's powerful.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:38.74,4:35:44.83,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as this fight continued on, all I could ask for was that they would just stop.
Dialogue: 2,4:35:44.83,4:35:46.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the fight continues,
Dialogue: 2,4:35:46.78,4:35:51.88,辉英,,0,0,0,,each growing weaker and weaker until the fight comes to its inevitable conclusion.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:10.57,4:38:12.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're now back at the farm house.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:12.52,4:38:17.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems to have been quite a while, since everything is so dilapidated.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:17.02,4:38:21.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,The house's empty, the paint chipping, the woods warped,
Dialogue: 2,4:38:21.50,4:38:24.72,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I think all of this is meant to show that Dina moved out with the baby
Dialogue: 2,4:38:24.72,4:38:26.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that Ellie is now alone.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:26.50,4:38:30.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,But regardless, it's been quite a while since anyone's been here.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:30.10,4:38:33.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so while it may be meant to show that Ellie is alone
Dialogue: 2,4:38:33.87,4:38:36.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that the ramifications for her actions
Dialogue: 2,4:38:36.86,4:38:40.96,辉英,,0,0,0,,have taken much more of a toll than just the loss of a couple fingers.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:40.96,4:38:42.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it might not be that simple,
Dialogue: 2,4:38:42.76,4:38:46.78,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this might actually be a happier ending than it might initially seem to be.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:46.78,4:38:48.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we'll get to that in just a few minutes.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:48.82,4:38:50.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie walks through the empty house,
Dialogue: 2,4:38:50.65,4:38:55.30,辉英,,0,0,0,,eventually coming into one room that has what seems to be most of Ellie's old things,
Dialogue: 2,4:38:55.30,4:38:58.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,and a lot of Joel's items that were collected throughout the house.
Dialogue: 2,4:38:58.66,4:39:00.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,She takes up Joel's guitar
Dialogue: 2,4:39:00.52,4:39:06.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,and plays a strained version of the song that he played for her in the beginning.
Dialogue: 2,4:39:06.04,4:39:12.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,Her missing fingers, now a permanent example of the distance between Joel and Ellie

Dialogue: 2,4:39:14.84,4:39:18.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,she can't even play the song properly or fully now.
Dialogue: 2,4:39:18.52,4:39:21.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,We then cut to the most important scene of the whole game.
Dialogue: 2,4:39:21.61,4:39:23.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,A scene that I couldn't do justice
Dialogue: 2,4:39:23.65,4:39:26.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if I were to spend weeks riding it outward for word.
Dialogue: 2,4:39:26.62,4:39:28.81,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead, I'm just going to let it play.
Dialogue: 2,4:45:32.17,4:45:34.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,And just like that, the game is over.
Dialogue: 2,4:45:34.87,4:45:38.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,Closing in on the same shot that the game opened up with,

Dialogue: 2,4:46:18.37,4:46:19.45,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it seems as though,

Dialogue: 2,4:46:35.75,4:46:40.60,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to accept that he's gone and to move on, living her life happily,

Dialogue: 2,4:47:52.45,4:47:56.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the most part, it works really well, except for some pacing issues.
Dialogue: 2,4:47:56.53,4:48:02.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,But a lot of those pacing issues are problematic, primarily because of the narrative
Dialogue: 2,4:48:02.61,4:48:07.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you want to focus on one character and you're having to keep swap between the two.
Dialogue: 2,4:48:07.12,4:48:09.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,But even so, there're some gameplay pacing issues,
Dialogue: 2,4:48:09.46,4:48:14.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,such as having problems with climax building
Dialogue: 2,4:48:14.39,4:48:19.87,辉英,,0,0,0,,and making sure that the final boss fights are really intriguing and interesting, and things like that.
Dialogue: 2,4:48:19.87,4:48:25.37,辉英,,0,0,0,,But all told, as far as the game is concerned, it's very well done as a game,

Dialogue: 2,4:49:50.64,4:49:53.74,辉英,,0,0,0,,I didn't realize I could connect with the character in the first game.
Dialogue: 2,4:49:53.74,4:49:58.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,And her actions in the second game make her very difficult to sympathize with.
Dialogue: 2,4:49:58.66,4:50:02.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because she's doing things that are objectively pretty dumb and stupid
Dialogue: 2,4:50:02.04,4:50:05.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,that aren't for the betterment of her and the people around her.
Dialogue: 2,4:50:05.95,4:50:08.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's being fairly selfish in what she's doing,
Dialogue: 2,4:50:08.47,4:50:14.98,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she does feel a… an obligation of sorts to Joel to continue on in her revenge journey.
Dialogue: 2,4:50:14.98,4:50:20.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,But still, it's not the same as the actions of Joel in the first game
Dialogue: 2,4:50:20.59,4:50:22.07,辉英,,0,0,0,,where he goes after Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,4:50:22.07,4:50:27.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though he's killing a lot of people to get to her and to save her from the Fireflies
Dialogue: 2,4:50:27.12,4:50:29.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,and everything they are about to do to her.
Dialogue: 2,4:50:29.28,4:50:32.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,At least there you can understand why he's doing it and you might even agreed
Dialogue: 2,4:50:32.70,4:50:34.27,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you care about Ellie too.
Dialogue: 2,4:50:34.27,4:50:36.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you might say I care about her so much,
Dialogue: 2,4:50:36.49,4:50:39.39,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would probably do the same thing if I was in his shoes.
Dialogue: 2,4:50:39.39,4:50:43.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,With Ellie in this game, many times, I found myself saying
Dialogue: 2,4:50:43.67,4:50:47.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would not have done that. That was the wrong choice, I don't agree with that.
Dialogue: 2,4:50:47.44,4:50:50.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,I care about you Ellie, and that's why I disagree with what you're doing.
Dialogue: 2,4:50:50.53,4:50:55.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,She's on a self destructive, borderline suicide mission throughout the entire game,
Dialogue: 2,4:50:55.93,4:50:59.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that just makes it so hard to sympathize with her, if not impossible.
Dialogue: 2,4:51:00.40,4:51:02.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when you don't sympathize with somebody,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:02.95,4:51:05.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,you shouldn't be surprised when people don't connect with them,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:05.53,4:51:07.33,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why, for a lot of people,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:07.33,4:51:12.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,they found themselves feeling as though that this wasn't a {\i1}TLOU{\i0} game, even by itself.
Dialogue: 2,4:51:12.76,4:51:16.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,It wasn't a sequel, it was a completely separate story.
Dialogue: 2,4:51:16.63,4:51:18.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie had grown up and become a different person,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:18.85,4:51:23.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she was almost unrecognisable from the character she was in the first game,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:23.50,4:51:27.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why Naughty Dog keep springing up all these flashbacks
Dialogue: 2,4:51:27.04,4:51:30.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,to kind of remind you of what Ellie used to be like.
Dialogue: 2,4:51:31.30,4:51:34.66,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that isn't enough, because you're playing in the current timeline.
Dialogue: 2,4:51:34.66,4:51:39.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if that Ellie is not enjoyable, isn't sympathetic, and you don't care about her,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:39.55,4:51:41.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,you don't care about her.
Dialogue: 2,4:51:41.08,4:51:43.51,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we bring up the question,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:43.51,4:51:47.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether or not Ellie is is a well written character in this story.
Dialogue: 2,4:51:47.86,4:51:50.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think for the story they were trying to tell she was well written,
Dialogue: 2,4:51:50.95,4:51:53.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it accomplish the purpose which for Naughty Dog
Dialogue: 2,4:51:53.94,4:52:00.00,辉英,,0,0,0,,was to make you sympathize with somebody that killed a character you loved and cared about,
Dialogue: 2,4:52:00.00,4:52:03.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,to make you see the other side of the story,
Dialogue: 2,4:52:03.58,4:52:05.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,to understand all the perspectives,
Dialogue: 2,4:52:05.76,4:52:08.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,and to get that sometimes violence isn't the answer.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:08.92,4:52:14.38,辉英,,0,0,0,,And sometimes, terrible things happen and are somewhat justified.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:14.38,4:52:18.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or that you could even find yourself in the shoes of that character doing that thing
Dialogue: 2,4:52:19.16,4:52:23.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you were put into some sort of like different circumstances, you know.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:23.17,4:52:27.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think that that's a really interesting story to tell.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:27.76,4:52:29.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think that's a fair story to tell.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:29.29,4:52:31.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's… when I think of the game that way,
Dialogue: 2,4:52:31.84,4:52:36.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,I find myself much more impressed with it and thinking that it's absolutely a masterpiece.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:37.42,4:52:40.91,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I think my frustration is that it was a {\i1}TLOU{\i0} game.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:41.48,4:52:49.09,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that they sacrifice not just Joel but also Ellie at the altar of that story.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:49.09,4:52:53.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because I don't think that creating new characters
Dialogue: 2,4:52:53.29,4:52:58.24,辉英,,0,0,0,,and telling the story from start to finish with new characters would have been as successful.
Dialogue: 2,4:52:58.24,4:53:05.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,”I think part of what makes that story arc of "Forgiving the Unforgivable", the title of this video.
Dialogue: 2,4:53:06.13,4:53:10.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that's part… of what of what makes it so impressive is that
Dialogue: 2,4:53:10.93,4:53:16.35,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are dealing with characters you've known effectively for a decade at this point.
Dialogue: 2,4:53:16.35,4:53:18.58,辉英,,0,0,0,,You've known for seven plus years,
Dialogue: 2,4:53:18.58,4:53:21.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,by the time you're watching this magnum for… for longer than that.
Dialogue: 2,4:53:22.45,4:53:26.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think that that's just what's really frustrating,
Dialogue: 2,4:53:26.52,4:53:31.28,辉英,,0,0,0,,but understandable is that they sacrifice these two characters that you love
Dialogue: 2,4:53:31.28,4:53:33.34,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the sake of telling this story,
Dialogue: 2,4:53:33.34,4:53:36.16,辉英,,0,0,0,,when they reassured us prior to launch
Dialogue: 2,4:53:36.16,4:53:40.84,辉英,,0,0,0,,that they were doing what was best for the characters that they weren't going to do them dirty,
Dialogue: 2,4:53:40.84,4:53:44.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,that this was what was best for Joel and Ellie,
Dialogue: 2,4:53:44.08,4:53:48.25,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they wouldn't be making the game if they didn't feel as though it was the right story to tell.
Dialogue: 2,4:53:49.72,4:53:53.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can understand the frustration on that end.
Dialogue: 2,4:53:53.80,4:53:57.46,辉英,,0,0,0,,A lot of people also are frustrated that the game doesn't seem to have a happy ending
Dialogue: 2,4:53:57.46,4:54:00.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,that Ellie lost everything then moves on.
Dialogue: 2,4:54:01.24,4:54:03.94,辉英,,0,0,0,,Forgets Joel and forgets Dina,
Dialogue: 2,4:54:03.94,4:54:06.20,辉英,,0,0,0,,and leaves everything behind and
Dialogue: 2,4:54:06.20,4:54:10.08,辉英,,0,0,0,,seemingly has lost everything hasn't gained, anything other than
Dialogue: 2,4:54:10.08,4:54:14.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,maybe coming to grips and peace with what happened with Joel moving on,
Dialogue: 2,4:54:14.17,4:54:17.14,辉英,,0,0,0,,leaving all of his stuff behind in the farmhouse.
Dialogue: 2,4:54:17.14,4:54:21.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I actually think that there's remnants of a happy ending here,
Dialogue: 2,4:54:21.13,4:54:23.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's something that's a small detail,
Dialogue: 2,4:54:23.02,4:54:29.90,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's something I didn't really consider until a good number of people had tweeted it at me
Dialogue: 2,4:54:29.90,4:54:35.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,and… had… mentioned it on Discord.
Dialogue: 2,4:54:35.02,4:54:38.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's something that once I started to investigate it, I was kind of blown away,
Dialogue: 2,4:54:38.11,4:54:40.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I thought that it's actually really interesting theory.
Dialogue: 2,4:54:40.68,4:54:46.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because you see at the end of the core story of {\i1}TLOU2{\i0} after Ellie and Abby have their fight out,
Dialogue: 2,4:54:47.05,4:54:53.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ellie is not wearing any sort of adornment, she is bare arrested.
Dialogue: 2,4:54:53.26,4:54:58.36,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when you see her back at the farmhouse, in the final scene of the game,
Dialogue: 2,4:54:58.36,4:55:01.75,辉英,,0,0,0,,she's actually wearing this very bracelet,
Dialogue: 2,4:55:01.75,4:55:05.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why it's interesting that they included it as part of the Collector's Edition.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:05.62,4:55:10.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually Dina's bracelet that she has.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:10.40,4:55:16.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the one that they include here, I mean, it's just it's a crappy little Collector's Edition.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:16.99,4:55:21.10,辉英,,0,0,0,,You know, trinket, but it's still it's still fun.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:21.10,4:55:23.13,辉英,,0,0,0,,But Ellie is wearing that.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:23.46,4:55:29.53,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Ellie wearing it even though seemingly she's split up with Dina,
Dialogue: 2,4:55:29.53,4:55:34.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Dina moved away and has completely cut ties.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:34.48,4:55:36.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the theory basically goes that
Dialogue: 2,4:55:36.76,4:55:41.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,they've returned to the house after a good amount of time, at least Ellie has.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:41.68,4:55:45.85,辉英,,0,0,0,,The house is cleared out, and they've decided to completely move on from Jackson.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:45.85,4:55:49.12,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're moving out, which is why the house is much more dilapidated.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:50.04,4:55:54.82,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Ellie has decided to leave all of Joel's things behind because she needs to move on,
Dialogue: 2,4:55:54.82,4:55:57.49,辉英,,0,0,0,,and she needs to stop bringing this with her.
Dialogue: 2,4:55:57.49,4:56:02.41,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so her wearing of the bracelet isn't just meant
Dialogue: 2,4:56:02.96,4:56:08.17,辉英,,0,0,0,,to symbolise that she still feels a connection with Dina,
Dialogue: 2,4:56:08.17,4:56:12.04,辉英,,0,0,0,,or that she misses Dina or wishes she had made a different decision.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:12.04,4:56:18.99,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that it's actually a direct message that she and Dina are back together.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:19.38,4:56:21.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that they've decided to move on together.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:21.76,4:56:26.11,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dina has forgiven Ellie, and that they are effectively living happily ever after.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:27.79,4:56:30.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now is that a stretch, perhaps… perhaps.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:30.32,4:56:35.29,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not many things in {\i1}TLOU{\i0}, at the world of {\i1}TLOU{\i0}, have happy endings.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:35.29,4:56:38.50,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I think the tone of the end of the game is very uplifting,
Dialogue: 2,4:56:38.50,4:56:40.63,辉英,,0,0,0,,very bright and sunny.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:40.63,4:56:46.15,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the title screen at the end of the game goes back to a sunny beach right outside the Resort,

Dialogue: 2,4:56:48.64,4:56:50.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,which I think symbolizes the same thing.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:50.92,4:56:54.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a bright, happy ending, morning has come.
Dialogue: 2,4:56:54.94,4:56:59.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,The light is always after the darkness, the sun has risen after night.

Dialogue: 2,4:57:03.24,4:57:04.48,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 2,4:57:04.96,4:57:08.02,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'd like to think that the story actually has a happy ending,
Dialogue: 2,4:57:08.02,4:57:12.61,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that Ellie and Dina and the baby all got back together.
Dialogue: 2,4:57:12.61,4:57:15.70,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they're off living in some cabin in the middle of nowhere.
Dialogue: 2,4:57:15.70,4:57:18.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,They've left Jackson and they've moved on
Dialogue: 2,4:57:18.44,4:57:21.32,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they're just not going to be burdened by any of this anymore.
Dialogue: 2,4:57:22.48,4:57:24.40,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's at least what I choose to believe,
Dialogue: 2,4:57:24.40,4:57:29.65,辉英,,0,0,0,,because I think Ellie deserves that ending after all of this,
Dialogue: 2,4:57:29.65,4:57:32.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so that's what I'm going to go with until I learn differently.
Dialogue: 2,4:57:32.92,4:57:40.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think the fact that the designers included the bracelet on Ellie's wrist at that ending farm scene
Dialogue: 2,4:57:40.62,4:57:45.67,辉英,,0,0,0,,is directly indicative of that being what happened.
Dialogue: 2,4:57:45.67,4:57:50.92,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's a little nod, maybe a little hint-hint that things actually ended happily,
Dialogue: 2,4:57:50.92,4:57:53.86,辉英,,0,0,0,,but who knows? I'd like to think that things ended happily.
Dialogue: 2,4:57:55.66,4:57:58.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,But all told, the game is very…
Dialogue: 2,4:57:59.26,4:58:02.31,辉英,,0,0,0,,difficult to come to terms with.
Dialogue: 2,4:58:02.31,4:58:08.68,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it wasn't what I was expecting and perhaps even hoping for.
Dialogue: 2,4:58:08.68,4:58:13.54,辉英,,0,0,0,,But even so, I think it succeeded in what it was trying to do as I said earlier in the video.
Dialogue: 2,4:58:13.54,4:58:17.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think the mission was to get you to sympathize with Abby
Dialogue: 2,4:58:17.62,4:58:24.55,辉英,,0,0,0,,and to flip the script so that you went from hating Abby to caring about her.
Dialogue: 2,4:58:24.55,4:58:28.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so when you reach this conclusion that you initially had hoped for,
Dialogue: 2,4:58:28.95,4:58:35.47,辉英,,0,0,0,,for Ellie to take on Abby and kill her, it feels empty and hollow and unsatisfying.
Dialogue: 2,4:58:35.47,4:58:40.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because you realize that this isn't as simple as just revenge.
Dialogue: 2,4:58:40.06,4:58:47.95,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think that that in and of itself as a narrative decision is truly remarkable.
Dialogue: 2,4:58:47.95,4:58:52.80,辉英,,0,0,0,,It really is, whether you love it or hate it, you've got to give Naughty Dog credit
Dialogue: 2,4:58:52.80,4:58:58.62,辉英,,0,0,0,,for having the balls to do something so unbelievably risky
Dialogue: 2,4:58:58.62,4:59:04.06,辉英,,0,0,0,,that has obviously polarized the fan base, pissed off a lot of people.
Dialogue: 2,4:59:04.06,4:59:08.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can only imagine the hate mail that they've received since this went live,
Dialogue: 2,4:59:08.59,4:59:11.59,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they knew that it would, they knew that it would.
Dialogue: 2,4:59:12.10,4:59:17.44,辉英,,0,0,0,,And… they chose to do it anyways, when they didn't need to.
Dialogue: 2,4:59:17.44,4:59:22.19,辉英,,0,0,0,,They could have done just an obligatory, you know, sequel

Dialogue: 2,4:59:29.44,4:59:33.52,辉英,,0,0,0,,And maybe right before the final scene, Abby kills Joel,
Dialogue: 2,4:59:33.52,4:59:37.03,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then Ellie gets revenge on Abby, wipes her out.
Dialogue: 2,4:59:37.03,4:59:41.26,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's kind of the {\i1}Uncharted{\i0} style ending where everything wraps up,
Dialogue: 2,4:59:41.26,4:59:42.76,辉英,,0,0,0,,but a character died in it.
Dialogue: 2,4:59:42.76,4:59:45.43,辉英,,0,0,0,,It makes you feel more appreciative of what you have,

Dialogue: 2,4:59:49.39,4:59:52.93,辉英,,0,0,0,,And while I think it would have been received well, the gameplay would have been really solid.

Dialogue: 2,4:59:59.93,5:00:03.57,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because as I've said for many many years at this point
